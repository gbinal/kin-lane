{% include JB/setup %}<p>Cloud computing is unleashing some serious power at our finger tips.If carefully planned you can scale ad deploy just about any technology scenario you wish.It takes time to put together the configuration and test out to make sure it scales properly.Once done you can tackle many tasks that used to take days or weeks.Such as:

	Mass Document Creation
	Mass Emailing
	Bulk Image and File Manipulation
	Data Creation and Cleanup
	And much more.</p>
