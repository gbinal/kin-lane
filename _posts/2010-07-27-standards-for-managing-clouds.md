     Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) announced the availability of the final two documents produced by its Open Cloud Standards Incubator, which is working to establish a strategy for cloud standards development. The documents: are Use Cases and Interactions for Managing Clouds Architecture for Managing Clouds These two documents will be the foundation for DMTF's ongoing cloud standards work.
