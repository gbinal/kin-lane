[<img class="alignnone c1" title="Distributed Management Task Force" src="http://www.dmtf.org/images/headermain/logo_dmtf.gif" alt="" width="128" height="43" align="right" />Distributed Management Task Force][1] (DMTF) announced the availability of the final two documents produced by its Open Cloud Standards Incubator, which is working to establish a [strategy for cloud standards development][2]. The documents: are

  * [Use Cases and Interactions for Managing Clouds][3]
  * [Architecture for Managing Clouds][4]
These two documents will be the foundation for DMTF's ongoing cloud standards work. Curious to see where the [OpenStack][5] plugs into this vision, there are a lot of players to keep track of in the cloud computing standards and open source game.
