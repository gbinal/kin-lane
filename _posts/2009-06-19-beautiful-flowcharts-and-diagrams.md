    I always want to visual my projects and ideas in easy to understand diagrams that are beautiful.I always look to Dion Hinchcliffe as the master of technical diagrams.I love his work.Being able to
    take a complex idea and articulate it in a single visual diagram that is universally understood is gold.So I want to get over my hump of creating very dull and boring diagrams using Microsoft
    Visio or other basic tool.
