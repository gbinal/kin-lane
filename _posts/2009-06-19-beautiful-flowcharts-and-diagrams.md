I always want to visual my projects and ideas in easy to understand [diagrams][1] that are beautiful. I always look to [Dion Hinchcliffe][2] as the [master of technical diagrams][2]. I love his work.

Being able to take a complex idea and articulate it in a single visual diagram that is universally understood is gold.

So I want to get over my hump of creating very dull and boring diagrams using Microsoft Visio or other basic tool.

I am research a couple of tools:

  * [Omniplan][3] \- A slick visual planning tool.
  * [OmniGraffle][4] \- A slick diagramming tool by the crew that made Omniplan.
