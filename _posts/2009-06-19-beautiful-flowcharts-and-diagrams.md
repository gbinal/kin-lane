I always want to visual my projects and ideas in easy to understand diagrams that are beautiful. I always look to Dion Hinchcliffe as the master of technical diagrams. I love his work.
Being able to take a complex idea and articulate it in a single visual diagram that is universally understood is gold.
So I want to get over my hump of creating very dull and boring diagrams using Microsoft Visio or other basic tool.
I am research a couple of tools:

	Omniplan - A slick visual planning tool.
	OmniGraffle - A slick diagramming tool by the crew that made Omniplan.
	Lovely Charts - The names says it all.

That is all for now...will keep looking and see what else I find.
