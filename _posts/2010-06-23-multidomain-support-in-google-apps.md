{% include JB/setup %}<p>Gooogle has opened upon support for companies to use multiple domains when setting up their Google Apps.The Google Apps control panel now allows administrators to manage multiple domains and assign to specific resources such as email, docs, and Google Sites.I was always just setting up separate Google Apps accounts for each domain, but now I can manage from a single Google Apps account.Multi-Domain support is available now to Premier and Education edition users at  no additional charge.To learn more about multi-domain support on Google  Apps, visit the Help  Center or there is a live  webinar on Tuesday, July 13th at 9am PST / 12pm EST / 5pm GMT.</p>
