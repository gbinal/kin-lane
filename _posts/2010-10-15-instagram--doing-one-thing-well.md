    I have talked in the past about doing one thing and doing it well in the technology space.A mistake Ive made many times, and other developers make is trying to do too much when building
    applications.You build a system and try to please everyone, by including lots of features, tools, integrations and support many platforms.I always tell myself, sllow it down!Focus on one thing
    and do it really well.
