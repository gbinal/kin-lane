    I really love the Amazon Web Services platform.It brings some really valuable tools to the table for deploying a companies infrastructure.However there are some areas that really can throw you
    for a loop.I create bundles and then ultimately AMIs from my core instances.It makes it so I can restore to last nights complete server if I want.
