<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/Manufacturing_supply_chain.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In preparation for [Maker Faire][1] this weekend I'm collecting more of my thoughts around 3D printing.

As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. This is a first post in my ongoing evaluation of the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.

I'm working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.

I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:

  * **[Creators][2]** \- 3D designers of virtual print objects
  * **[Scanners][3]** \- Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
  * **Modeling Software** \- Applications for building 3D models
  * **[File Formats][4]** \- File formats for storing 3D models
  * **[Warehousing][5]** \- Virtual storage for 3D models
  * **[Marketplaces][6]** \- Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
  * **[Printers][7]** \- Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
  * ****
