{% include JB/setup %}<p>In preparation for Maker Faire this weekend Im collecting more of my thoughts around 3D printing.As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts.This is a first post in my ongoing evaluation of  the role of APIs in 3D printing and manufacturing.Im working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.Ive identified 10 major components of 3D printing:

	Creators - 3D designers of virtual print objects
	Scanners - Scanning hardware for generating 3D models
	Modeling Software - Applications for building 3D models
	File Formats - File formats for storing 3D models
	Warehousing - Virtual storage for 3D models
	Marketplaces - Arenas for showcasing, distributing and ordering 3D products
	Printers - Companies and hardware that deliver 3D printing
	Process &amp; Materials - The process and materials that go into 3D printing
	Makers - The people who understand 3D printers, process, materials and industries
	Delivery - Logistics behind getting 3D printed products to consumers

Of course this is just my perspective of the industry and can evolve as I learn more, and collaborate with other industry players.</p>
