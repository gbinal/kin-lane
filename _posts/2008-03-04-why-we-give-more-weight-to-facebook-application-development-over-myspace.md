I was just reading [MySpace Developer Platform: Jim Benedetto, MySpace][1] on Jeremiah Owyang's blog. He is at the Social Graph Conference in San Diego. I wish I was there.

Anyways he was posting a bunch of information about the MySpace development platform and it really shows an impressive approach on their part in reaching out to the developers community.

Their approach is much better than Facebook.

Yet we still give more priority to building Facebook apps and maintaing our presence there than we do on MySpace.

It is primarily because of the demographics. It will be interesting to see who stays ahead in the Social Networking race.
