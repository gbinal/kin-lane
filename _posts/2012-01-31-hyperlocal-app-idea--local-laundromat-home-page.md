{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am sitting at the&nbsp;Wash Tub Laundromat in Manhattan Beach, CA&nbsp;doing my laundry tonight.I was working on my Macbook and the owner of the laundromat asked me if I was able to get wifi on my laptop?I explained that I have a Verizon USB stick to get my Internet connection, since there wasn&rsquo;t wifi available.He said he had talked to Time Warner Cable and they said they&rsquo;d install free Internet for him, but it had been months and nothing.I&rsquo;m assuming they have some sort of public spaces package that routes users to a home page, upon connecting and monetizes the Internet using advertising.</p>
