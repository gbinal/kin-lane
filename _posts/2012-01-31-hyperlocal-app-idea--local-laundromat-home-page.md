    I am sitting at the&nbsp;Wash Tub Laundromat in Manhattan Beach, CA&nbsp;doing my laundry tonight.I was working on my Macbook and the owner of the laundromat asked me if I was able to get wifi on
    my laptop?I explained that I have a Verizon USB stick to get my Internet connection, since there wasn’t wifi available.He said he had talked to Time Warner Cable and they said they’d install free
    Internet for him, but it had been months and nothing.I’m assuming they have some sort of public spaces package that routes users to a home page, upon connecting and monetizes the Internet using
    advertising.
