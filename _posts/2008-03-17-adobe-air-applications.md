So recently I have installed 2 Adobe Air applications. I installed [twhirl a twitter client][1] built on the Air platform, and now I just did [Snippely a snippet code tool][2] from [MooTools][3].

I really like the install process which is very smooth and makes installing new apps so easy.

I really like the application itself too. They are very sexy, clean interfaces and lightweight. They have all the functionality of a desktop application but seem like a browser web app as well.

Interesting blend, would like to find time and play with developing Air apps myself.
