    So recently I have installed 2 Adobe Air applications. I installed <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">twhirl a twitter client</a> built on the Air platform, and now I just did <a href=
    "http://blog.mootools.net/2008/3/15/snippely">Snippely a snippet code tool</a> from <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a>.<br />
    <br />
    I really like the install process which is very smooth and makes installing new apps so easy.<br />
    <br />
    I really like the application itself too. They are very sexy, clean interfaces and lightweight. They have all the functionality of a desktop application but seem like a browser web app as
    well.<br />
    <br />
    Interesting blend, would like to find time and play with developing Air apps myself.
