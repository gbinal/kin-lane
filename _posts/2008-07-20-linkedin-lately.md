    I just signed up for a business account for our business Social Media Squad.Im curious what it will bring me.I think LinkedIn is on a good path, they are moving to provide more value to us
    business owners.Ive started monitoring the questions and answers on LinkedIn more.I find a lot of valuable information on there and make some good connections as well.
