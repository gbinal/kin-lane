{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just signed up for a business account for our business Social Media Squad.  I'm curious what it will bring me.   I think LinkedIn is on a good path, they are moving to provide more value to us business owners.I've started monitoring the questions and answers on LinkedIn more.  I find a lot of valuable information on there and make some good connections as well.Most people I connect with on an answer usually add me as a connection.I'm going to play around with training myself to remember questions I have and start posting questions as well.</p>
