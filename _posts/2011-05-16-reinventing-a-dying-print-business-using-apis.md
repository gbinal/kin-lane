    As an evangelist for a print API, I often get asked, What are you doing working in a dying industry?I dont see the print industry as dying, I see it as evolving.I often say that the largest and
    loudest sectors of print are making a lot of noise, and have trouble adjusting.I see the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API as my opportunity help re-invent the print industry.I pay attention to how
    APIs transform many different industries, an example of this is the telephone directory business.
