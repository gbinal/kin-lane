    I am starting a new personal tradition. I have never really been into new years resoutions, but I do get excited about the new possibility of each coming here. I also tend to look for ways to
    measure up the ending year and see what I accomplished. I am writing a list of what is real importatnt to me personally and professionally at the moment, and things I would like to do for the
    following year. I am rewriting my personal bio as well. This is the overview I post to most of my social network and business profiles on and offline. Hopefully this can help give me something to
    work towards as well as be able to measure up what I accomplished over the year.
