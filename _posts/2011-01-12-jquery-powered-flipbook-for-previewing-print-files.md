    On my hunt for killer scripts and tools to go with with my Cloud Print API, I came across a way cool JQuery Flipbook script over at codecanyon.Flipbook jQuery provides a magazine / book style
    display for digital media.The features include: JQuery Powered Works with images, videos, audio and text Includes ZoomVideoPlayer Lightbox support It also allows you to customize the width /
    height of the gallery.Im going to be bundling it with cloud printing bundle for previewing and interacting with print documents before sending off to be physically printed.I dont think digital
    media delivered in a Flipbook format is a replacement for books or magazines, but is a great way to preview or browse content before physically committing to having it printed.
