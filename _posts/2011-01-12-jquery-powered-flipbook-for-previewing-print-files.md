    On my hunt for killer scripts and tools to go with with my Cloud Print API, I came across a way cool <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/flipbook-jquery-powered-w-media-gallery/152110" target=
    "_blank">JQuery Flipbook</a> script over at <a href="http://codecanyon.net/" target="_blank">codecanyon</a>. <img style="padding: 20px;" src=
    "http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/jquery-flipbook.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/flipbook-jquery-powered-w-media-gallery/152110"
    target="_blank">Flipbook jQuery</a> provides a magazine / book style display for digital media. The features include:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>
        <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> Powered
      </li>
      <li>Works with images, videos, audio and text
      </li>
      <li>Includes ZoomVideoPlayer
      </li>
      <li>Lightbox support
      </li>
    </ul>It also allows you to customize the width / height of the gallery. I'm going to be bundling it with cloud printing bundle for previewing and interacting with print documents before sending
    off to be physically printed. I don't think digital media delivered in a Flipbook format is a replacement for books or magazines, but is a great way to preview or browse content before physically
    committing to having it printed.
