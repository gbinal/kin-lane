I am working with several Google APIs this evening. I am pulling my [Gmail Messages using Oauth][1]. In the Google Code samples they use [Zend Framework][2].

When I had my web development company I made the transition from ASP to PHP I used the Zend framework as a backbone to my platform. So I am familiar.

Looking through the libraries I think its definitely time to rediscover the [Zend Framework][2] and save myself some time and energy.
