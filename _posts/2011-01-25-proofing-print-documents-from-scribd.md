    I recently created a couple of working examples using Scribd API and the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API: Pulling a PDF Using Scribd API and PHP Proofing a Scribd PDF Using Mimeo Connect I want to
    help developers integrate Scribd document storage and Mimeo printing into their applications.You can see this in action on my working example, Pulling a PDF from Scribd and Proofing with Mimeo.I
    have also created a git and svn repository so you can check out these projects: git (github) repository svn (google code) repository I will be updating this code base whenever I do new work or
    prototypes around Scribd and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print.
