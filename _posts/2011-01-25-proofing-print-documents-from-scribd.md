I recently created a couple of working examples using [Scribd][1] [API][2] and the [Mimeo][3] Connect [Cloud Print][4] API:

  * [Pulling a PDF Using Scribd API and PH][5]P
  * [Proofing a Scribd PDF Using Mimeo Connect][6]
I want to help developers integrate Scribd document storage and Mimeo [printing][7] into their applications. [<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Scribd.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][8] You can see this in action on my working example, [Pulling a PDF from Scribd and Proofing with Mimeo][9].

I have also created a git and svn repository so you can check out these projects:

  * [git (github) repository][10]
  * [svn (google code) repository][11]
I will be updating this code base whenever I do new work or prototypes around Scribd and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print.
