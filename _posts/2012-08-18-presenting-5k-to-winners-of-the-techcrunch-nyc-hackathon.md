     While contracting with CityGrid this spring, one event I sponsored and participated in was the TechCrunch NYC Hackathon.  The hackathon was definitely one of the larger hackathons I've attended, filling an entire warehouse.   I gave a workshop on how to use the CityGrid hackathon, then after the hackathon was over, my co-worker Prashanth Ramdas and I got on stage and presented 5K to the winners, WhatNow, a local discovery service.
