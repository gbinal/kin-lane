While contracting with [CityGrid][1] this spring, one event I sponsored and participated in was the [TechCrunch NYC Hackathon][2].  The hackathon was definitely one of the larger hackathons I've attended, filling an entire warehouse.  

I gave a workshop on how to use the CityGrid hackathon, then after the hackathon was over, my co-worker [Prashanth Ramdas][3] and I got on stage and presented 5K to the winners, WhatNow, a local discovery service.
