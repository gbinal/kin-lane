     While contracting with <a href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a> this spring, one event I sponsored and participated in was the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/20/introducing-our-2012-disrupt-nyc-hackathon-winners-thingscription-poachbase-and-practikhan/">TechCrunch NYC Hackathon</a>. &nbsp;The hackathon was definitely one of the larger hackathons I've attended, filling an entire warehouse. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
     I gave a workshop on how to use the CityGrid hackathon, then after the hackathon was over, my co-worker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/pramdas">Prashanth Ramdas</a> and I got on stage and presented 5K to the winners, WhatNow, a local discovery service.
