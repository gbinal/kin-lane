    While contracting with CityGrid this spring, one event I sponsored and participated in was the TechCrunch NYC Hackathon.&nbsp;The hackathon was definitely one of the larger hackathons Ive
    attended, filling an entire warehouse.&nbsp; I gave a workshop on how to use the CityGrid hackathon, then after the hackathon was over, my co-worker&nbsp;Prashanth Ramdas and I got on stage and
    presented 5K to the winners, WhatNow, a local discovery service.
