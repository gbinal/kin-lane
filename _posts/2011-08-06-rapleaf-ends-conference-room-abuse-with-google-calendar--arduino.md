    Consumer information technology company, Rapleaf, uses Google Calendar to schedule meetings in their nine conference rooms, but despite this organization they still suffer from Conference Room
    Abuse!Conference Room Abuse is where people 2 or more people randomly grab a conference without any regard to the schedule for the room.Its a problem many companies face.To solve the problem
    Rapleaf designed the Roominator, an open-source system of hardware and software that helps deal with conference room scheduling.Bryan Duxbury of Rapleaf talks about what went into the Roominator:
    The hardware consists of two parts: a display unit thats posted outside of each conference room, and a controller unit thats located in Rapleafs wiring closet.
