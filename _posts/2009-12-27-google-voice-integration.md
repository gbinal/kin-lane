{% include JB/setup %}<p>My Firefox browser opens all my default tabs when it opens and gives me quick access to all my core web applications. One of these is Google Voice.
I am still working Google Voice into my overall platform. It isn't quite there.
Today I was thinking about some good uses for it beyond receiving calls. I was mourning the deactivation of Google Notebook and thinking that Google Voice would make a good replacement for my note taking. Make it more verbal. I would like to see Google Voice to be integrated through my Google Office. When editing a document I could leave audio notes. When creating or editing a calendar event I could leave audio notes. These notes would show up in my Google Voice account and I could organize or maybe they would automatically organize by Google Application?
I have a Google Voice widget on my web site so people could call me. Seems like Google could release a simple widget I could use and call myself. Then I could leave messages, notes, and general dictation. These audio notes would then be transcribed and available as part of my overall communication stream.
Just some random thoughts of how I see Google Voice growing and evolving as part of my core platform.
