The [DeltaCloud API][1] provides a single API interface to work with multiple cloud computing providers.

With the[DeltaCloud API][2] you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another on[Amazon EC2][3] or[Rackspace][4].

The DeltaCloud Core provides a RESTful API, and backward compatibility across different versions of support cloud platforms.

[Deltacloud API][5] supports the following providers:<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/delta-cloud-api.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" />

  * [Amazon EC2][3]
  * [GoGrid][6]
  * [OpenNebula][7]
  * [Rackspace][4]
  * [RHEV-M][8]
  * [RimuHosting][9]
DeltaCloud is open-source and downloadable by anyone.

Currently there is no available DeltaCloud API as a service. Anyone can download and deploy, but there is no Softare as a Service (SaaS) version.

I smell anopportunityfor someone to offer as a service, and provide an on-demand [universal cloud computing web API][10].
