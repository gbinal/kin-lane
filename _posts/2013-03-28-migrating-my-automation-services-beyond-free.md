    I depend on If This Then That (IFTTT) to move data around the cloud.&nbsp;I syndicate blog posts from API Evangelist to Blogger and Tumblr.&nbsp;This isnt just blind syndication, it is SEO and
    also plan B scenarios to make sure my content exists in multiple areas.When it comes to the IT decisions for API Evangelist, I carefully evaluate what services I use.&nbsp;If I begin to depend on
    an account, after 6 months I need to start paying a fee to secure some sort of quality of service (QOS).
