     Could have asked for better timing between a link from Audrey and email from Visually.  Such an important message I want to share in 2013.  I will be making this a theme. Please be responsible with your Infographic creation in 2013, and make sure and check your sources and provide the data behind. I predict in 2013 we will see more infographics with actual data behind them, but like with data journalism at The Guardian. Thanks to Visual.ly and Alaska Robotics for use of their images! :)
