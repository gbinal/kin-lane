Just read another post with data backing up the growth as Google Android as an application development platform. A post from ReadWriteWeb called "More Developers Start Working on Android Apps" has some good data from Flurry on application platform growth for Iphone, Blackberry, and Android.
The post states:
Flurry's stats for Android are definitely encouraging, and there can be little doubt that more and more developers are starting to look at Android as an alternative platform - especially since Apple's App Store approval process continues to be a mess.
Which backs up what I have been saying about the growth of Google Android as a viable mobile platform in 2009 and 2010.
Definitely something to watch if you are considering developing an application for Iphone, Android or Blackberry.
