Just read another post with data backing up the [growth as Google Android][1] as an application development platform. A post from [ReadWriteWeb][2] called "[More Developers Start Working on Android Apps][3]" has some good data from [Flurry][4] on application platform growth for Iphone, Blackberry, and Android.

The post states:

**_Flurry's stats for Android are definitely encouraging, and there can be little doubt that more and more developers are starting to look at Android as an alternative platform - especially since Apple's App Store approval process continues to be a mess._**

Which backs up what I have been saying about the [growth of Google Android as a viable mobile platform][1] in 2009 and 2010.

Definitely something to watch if you are considering [developing an application for Iphone, Android or Blackberry][5].
