    Amazon published today that Relational Database Service (RDS) now supports SSL encrypted connections.You can now generate an SSL certificate for each database instance.Here are a few of the
    details about Relational Database Service (RDS) SSL connections: SSL encrypts the data transferred over the wire between your DB Instance and your application.It does not protect data at rest.If
