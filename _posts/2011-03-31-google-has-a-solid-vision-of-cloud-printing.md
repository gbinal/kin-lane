    Google is moving forward with their vision of Cloud Printing in a much larger, comprehensive and decisive way compared with HP ePrint or Apple Airprint.They have rolled out the Google Cloud Print
    Services Interface as well as an XMPP jobs notification system.GCP supports printing on mobile phones using Google Docs and Gmail, while also supporting printing in Chrome on Windows, and now on
    the Mac Platform.They quickly evolved from a Google Client Login to support OAuth 2.0, to keep in line with the rest of the Google API ecosystem when it comes to authentication.
