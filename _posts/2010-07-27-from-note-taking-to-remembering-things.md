<img class="alignnone c1" title="Evernote" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/evernote.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" />I'm always working to clean up my platform and better use tools already in my toolbox. I have been using Google Notebook for quite a few years now. I have a lot of information in there, good and bad. Google discontinued Notebook quite a while ago, so I stopped using it. I kind of quit taking notes all together.

I have had an [Evernote][1] account for a while, but don't fully use it. Audrey's religious use of [Evernote][1] has motivated me to use it more. I use the:

  * Evernote Web Application
  * Evernote IPhone Application
  * Evernote Desktop Application
Tonight I finished importing my Google Notebooks into my Evernote account. I am spending some time organizing my notebooks and get back into the groove.

I am permanently turning off my Google Notebook and start using Evernote as a daily part of my platform. I will evolve from note taking to actually remembering things with [Evernote][1].
