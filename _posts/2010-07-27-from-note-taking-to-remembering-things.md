    Im always working to clean up my platform and better use tools already in my toolbox.I have been using Google Notebook for quite a few years now.I have a lot of information in there, good and
    bad.Google discontinued Notebook quite a while ago, so I stopped using it.I kind of quit taking notes all together.
