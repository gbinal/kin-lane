{% include JB/setup %}I have been using wordpress installations for content development. I am working on a couple of books and whitepapers.
The white papers should be much shorter than the books. However the platform seems to work with my way of evolving the content for these papers and books.
Even one book I am making public as I am writing it. Just because it is a hobby project. I like the blog format because it organizes things by date as I write them. I can also categorize them.
Then I can write more linear pages and pull together the different areas. I also like the linking in between topics and pulling together. I really makes a non linear book.
We'll see where I go with this content development.
