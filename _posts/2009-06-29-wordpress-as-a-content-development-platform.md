I have been using wordpress installations for [content development][1]. I am working on a couple of books and whitepapers.

The [white papers][2] should be much shorter than the books. However the platform seems to work with my way of evolving the content for these papers and books.

Even one book I am making public as I am writing it. Just because it is a hobby project. I like the blog format because it organizes things by date as I write them. I can also categorize them.

Then I can write more linear pages and pull together the different areas. I also like the linking in between topics and pulling together. I really makes a non linear book.

We'll see where I go with this content development.
