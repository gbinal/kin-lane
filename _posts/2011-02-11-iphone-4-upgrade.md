     I just made the upgrade from my IPhone 3GS to IPhone 4. I 've been waiting because it is really a luxury, not a need. However my IPhone is getting slower and slower and was actually keeping me from doing work. <img class="c1"

</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google
     </li>

     <li>Twitter
     </li>

     <li>Facebook
     </li>

     <li>Evernote
     </li>

     <li>Instagram
     </li>

     <li>Foursquare
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     I have a Remote Desktop Client (<a class="zem_slink"
        title="Remote Desktop Protocol"
        rel="wikipedia"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>) that is essential for server support, but not a daily use application. I found it interesting what apps I rely on daily. I tend to browse more than I rely on apps, even though I have downloaded quite a few, they don't stick. I'm sure Kaia will download plenty of games on there during the time(s) we are together, wait she has a new IPod?
