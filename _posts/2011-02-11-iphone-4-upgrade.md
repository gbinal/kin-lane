{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just made the upgrade from my IPhone 3GS to IPhone 4.I ve been waiting because it is really a luxury, not a need.However my IPhone is getting slower and slower and was actually keeping me from doing work.I chose not to have the store transfer my data, I enjoy doing myself and rewiring my world.Finding new ways of doing things if possible.</p>
