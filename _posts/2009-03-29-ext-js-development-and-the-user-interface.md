    I have been doing a lot of development lately using the EXTJS framework.I have been setting it up to consume JSON from Web Services I have been setting up.At first it was cumbersome to even get
    some basic administrative tools setup and working.The more I setup the fast it gets though.I am creating various basic controls that are pre-configured to just ping a CFC and get their data.
