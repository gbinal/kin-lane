One event I am looking forward to is the SXSW 2011 conference. Audrey and I are planning way ahead so that we can attend the Music and Interactive parts of the event.
I am very excited about the potential lineup for both tech and music. What also gets me going is the way they begin the Call for Papers process. They always crowd-source their panel selection using their PanelPicker.
I really feel this type of crowd-sourced approach to building an event is critical for building a loyal fan-base of attendees.
Involving your audience in the beginning and through every stage of the event planning, preparation, execution and post event wrap up is just smart event management in this digital / social era.
