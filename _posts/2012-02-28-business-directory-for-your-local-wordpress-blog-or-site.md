{% include JB/setup %}<p>I finished the first version of a business directory WordPress plugin that you can use to deploy a local directory for your Wordpress site or blog.I wanted to make an easy way for non-developers, to launch a local directory for one or multiple business categories.The Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin uses two APIs:

CityGrid Places API
CityGrid Advertising API

To install the CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin you have two options:

Search for it and install using the Plugin Search in your Wordpress site (this is the easiest).Download it from the Wordpress plugin directory or via Github, and upload using the plugin upload in your Wordpress site.Once installed you should see a new menu in your Wordpress admin menu, called CityGrid.</p>
