I finished the first version of a [business directory WordPress plugin][1] that you can use to deploy a local directory for your Wordpress site or blog. I wanted to make an easy way for non-developers, to launch a local directory for one or multiple business categories.

The Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin uses two APIs:

  * [CityGrid Places API][2]
  * [CityGrid Advertising API][3]

To install the CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin you have two options:

  * Search for it and install using the Plugin Search in your Wordpress site (this is the easiest).
  * Download it from the [Wordpress plugin directory][4] or via [Github][5], and upload using the "plugin upload" in your Wordpress site.

Once installed you should see a new menu in your Wordpress admin menu, called CityGrid. It contains an overview of the plugin and a setting page for configuring your Wordpress directory.

Using the settings page you can configure five elements of your local business directory:

  * **CityGrid Publisher Code** \- The API key that gives you access to CityGrid business data.
  * **Directory Label** \- What your directory will be called on your sites menu.
  * **Where** \- A location of "where" you want to provide a search for, this can include: Cities, Neighborhoods, Zip Codes, Metro Areas, Addresses and Intersections.
  * **What** \- Keywords separated by commas (pizza, pubs, hair salon, auto parts). Each keyword or phrase will create new page and directory.
  * **Ads** \- Whether or not you want to show ads on your site.

I tried to find strike a balance between simplicity, while also giving site owners a very robust local directory for their site. My goal is to empower non-developers with the ability to launch local business directories for any topic or geographic location at a city level.

This is just version 1.0 of the [CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin][6], so if you find problems, or there are things you would like to see in future versions, please tweet your feedback [@citygridapiteam][7] or leave comments on the [CityGrid Dev Talk Forum][8].
