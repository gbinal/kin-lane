    I have been working on a prototype for using the Federated Google Account login that uses the OpenID 2.0 standard.Really a nice concept to offer for users who are heavy users of Google, Yahoo or
    other 3rd party service providers that have adopted OpenID.I am proposing offering a Login Using Google button on all our public application logins which then send a request to Google and allows
    the user to authenticate our domain(s) under their Google Account.Then they can utilize a single click login in the future without remembering yet another username and password.
