[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/pen-io-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />][1]I really enjoy web applications that focus on doing one thing, and doing it well.

[Pen.io][1] is one of these apps. Pen.io is the fastest way to publish online. period.

Pen.io allows you to add, edit, and delete pages. Thats it.

You just give your page a title, set a password, and add. Then you can edit the body of your page and publish.

[Pen.io just launched a new API][2] to support the web application. It allows you to:

  * Authenticate
  * Create New Page
  * Update Page Content
  * Check Page Availability
  * Get Page in HTML Format
  * Get Page in JSON Format
  * Get Page in XML Format
  * Delete a Page
The [Pen.io API][3] is RESTful and authenticates using an application key in the header.

They provide a directory of pages, about, blog, faq, and contact page.

It doesn't get much simpler than that. It is a very elegant representation of a Software as a Service for a single resource.
