    I have been in the Amazon Console all night scaling down infrastructure after 3 months of events and conferences.This year our Amazon spend was double during the event season.Last year I pushed
    what my budget would allow to achieve better performance, it paid off.This year I got the thumbs up to push even further (even though I think I may have pushed a little further than I should
    have), with the amount to spend on processor power.Anyways, while data was moving around and Amazon Machine Images (AMI) were being created last night I was playing in the Amazon Console.
