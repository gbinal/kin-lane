    I am formulating my thoughts around data portability and how it will affect life as I continue to become 100% web-based in my work and personal life.I thought as I am working through it I would
    talk about here and help users understand their data portability, the standards and why it is important to have.So this first post I guess is about what is data portability.So in this Web 2.0
    world we are increasingly interacting with other people and services online.
