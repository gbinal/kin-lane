{% include JB/setup %}<p>When I am building a user interface for any print application I want to allow users to preview their PDF after upload.The Mimeo Proofing Service is what I use.Proofing takes a PDF and generates a small and large image for each page of the PDF, and adds to your Mimeo account.First I pull the PDF, and send it to the Mimeo Proofing Service, and it returns XML containing a list of all the proofed images for PDF.I created a PHP script that allows you to preview a PDF you are about to print in a flipbook format.</p>
