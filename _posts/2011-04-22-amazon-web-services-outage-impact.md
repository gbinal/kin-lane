    I wrote a post yesterday on the Amazon outage, and half jokingly saidAmazon Should Pull Plug Regularly to Show Which Companies Do Not Have It Together.Of course I dont think Amazon should do
    this, but I wanted to highlight Clays great post on the topic.I wanted to take another side of the outage now.About 6 months ago I responded to a good friends request for advice on moving to the
    cloud.His has been an ISP since the early days of the Internet.
