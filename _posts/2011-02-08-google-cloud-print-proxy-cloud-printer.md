{% include JB/setup %}I have some working code for a Google Cloud Print Proxy.  It is currently written in PHP and uses the Zend framework.
I have written specific blog posts for each service endpoint, and to finish up I wanted to do a complete walk-through.
First I authenticate against a users Google Account with Google ClientLogin API.
Then using the Google Cloud Print Services Interface:

	http://www.google.com/cloudprint/interface/

I can make calls to the following end points to manage printers:

	/register
	/list
	/update
	/delete

I can make calls to the following end points to manage cloud print jobs:

	/fetch
	/control

You can receive print job notifications via persistent XMPP connection:

	XMPP Print Job Notifications

If you want to download the sample code for my Google Cloud Print Proxy work, you can download in the following formats:

	git - Github
	svn - Google Code

If you have any thoughts or ideas for an innovative Cloud Print Proxy, let me know.

UPDATE 2/28/2011 - I have finished the first prototype for the XMPP print job notification service.  This is critical piece to eliminate constant polling of /fetch service.
