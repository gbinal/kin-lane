    "amazon Simple Notification Service now supports SMS text messages" href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon Simple Notification Service now supports SMS text messages</a> as a new method for
    notifications. Now with support for SMS text messaging, Amazon SNS messages can be delivered to SMS-enabled phone. For those of you who aren't familiar, <a title="Amazon SNS" href=
    "http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon SNS</a> is a web service that makes it easy to send notifications from the cloud to applications or people. It provides developers with a scalable, flexible,
    and cost-effective way to publish messages and have them immediately delivered in many formats, to a wide range of devices. Previously Amazon SNS supported message deliveries via http, email or
    to Amazon SQS queues. Notifications can now be sent as text messages to cell phones, smart phones or any other device that supports SMS. This new Amazon SNS feature can be accessed from the
    <a title="AWS Management Console" href="http://console.aws.amazon.com">AWS Management Console</a>. SMS notification support is currently supported in the US-East region, and will be available in
    other AWS regions and countries in the coming months.
