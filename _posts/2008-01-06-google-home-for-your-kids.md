    A while back I started helping my daughter Kaia build her blog at http://kaialane.blogspot.com/.She really likes making pictures and stories and posting there from time to time.Recently she has
    been learning to read and write more so she started to want to chat with me and got on her moms IM and would talk to me at work.
