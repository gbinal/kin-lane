{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just added a new entry to theMimeo Idea Showcase.It is an idea forpersonalized, print-on-demand coupon books.This idea comes from my co-worker Heath.His thoughts are:
Seems like a subscription service to pick the stores near you have coupon books printed and delivered from a site like Coupon Cabin, would be pretty cool.A rare case where the printed pages have true monetary value.</p>
