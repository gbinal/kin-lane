    Deeper and deeper I dive into HTML 5.The WebSocket API allows bidirectional communications with a server.Think of this one as how you wish AJAX would have been.Not only do you have Server-Sent
    Events with HTML 5, you can actually have multi-directional communication with any web server.This really opens up the possibilities of making web applications more real-time.
