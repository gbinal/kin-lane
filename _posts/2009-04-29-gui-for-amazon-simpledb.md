I really love the [Amazon][1] [SimpleDB][1] tool. The concept is great. Many of the web applications I build use only very basic database functionality.

I have come across many companies that use SQL Server and pay the license but they only use 10% of the functionality. They use it for Simple Storage.

So I have really advocated for the movement to [Amazon SimpleDB][1] as a database back end whenever possible. I haven't been very successful, even with my own pet projects.

So I stumbled acrossed a post about someone who built a [Query Tool for Amazon SimpleDB][2].

I think this will really help move forward Amazon SimpleDB adoption. Quite a few developers I know need a GUI tool to help them write queries.
