{% include JB/setup %}<p>I really love the Amazon SimpleDB tool.The concept is great.Many of the web applications I build use only very basic database functionality.I have come across many companies that use SQL Server and pay the license but they only use 10% of the functionality.They use it for Simple Storage.</p>
