    I really love the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">Amazon</a> <a rel="wikipedia" href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a> tool. The concept is great. Many of the web
    applications I build use only very basic database functionality. I have come across many companies that use SQL Server and pay the license but they only use 10% of the functionality. They use it
    for Simple Storage. So I have really advocated for the movement to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">Amazon SimpleDB</a> as a database back end whenever possible. I haven't been very
    successful, even with my own pet projects. So I stumbled acrossed a post about someone who built a <a href="http://coderslike.us/2009/04/15/query-tool-for-amazon-simpledb/">Query Tool for Amazon
    SimpleDB</a>. I think this will really help move forward Amazon SimpleDB adoption. Quite a few developers I know need a GUI tool to help them write queries.
