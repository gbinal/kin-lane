    I am not blogging to among the A list bloggers or drive large amounts of traffic to my blog.I do this primarily for myself and as a result I tend to have some readers and followers.At conferences
    I tend to take notes and when I find time and get in the blogging spirit I will blog about these topics.So here are some thoughts form the Google IO Keynote.It was a good keynote.
