The next area they covered is the Geo Awareness of the next generation of browsers. They triangulate your position based upon wifi and cell tower ID's. This is definitely the future of web applications. Your browser knowing where you are and delivers information and advertising based upon th
Then they dove into android and where it is going. It is a slick platform that emphasizes the importance of mobile
They underscored this by giving everyone android phones
