{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just test driving the Free Screenshot Sharing Application called SPGrab.I like the idea of seamless sharing after you take a screenshot.They allow you to automatically upload to FTP location of your choice.Putting it in a ftp location you potentially have the ability to automatically share it.I spend a lot of time uploading screenshots to a Google Doc, Worpdress Blog or orther online tool.</p>
