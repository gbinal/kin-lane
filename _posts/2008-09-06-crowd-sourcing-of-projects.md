I am seeing more and more talk of crowd sourcing of projects.  I am reading more about virtual assistants and how they are changing how businesses operate and grow their business in this tough economy.In my work with Ahren over at Social Media Squad I have assisted him in the development of crowd sourced strategies for social media marketing campaigns.It is not without its problems, we have trouble finding quality and reliable talent sometimes....and we fall short of targeted goals from time to time.However we are really dialing in some great process for crowd source execution of projects and individual tasks.  I have worked with some serious talent that is working from home as a mother, student, or other capacities.I am really eager to see where crowd sourcing and virtual assistants go in the mainstream employment and business human resource process.
