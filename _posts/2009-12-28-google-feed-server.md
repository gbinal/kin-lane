Google Feed Server is an open source [Atom Publishing Protocol][1] server based on the [Apache Abdera][2] framework. Google Feed Server provides a simple back end for data adapters, which allows developers to quickly deploy a feed for an existing data source such as a database.

Google Feed Server also provides the Feed Server Client Tool (FSCT), which lets developers perform create, receive, update, and delete ([CRUD][3]) operations on a Feed Server feed.
