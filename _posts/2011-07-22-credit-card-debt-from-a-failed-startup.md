    Here is a little reminder for all the startup hungry folks out there.This is a dashboard widget for my debt consolidation, for all the credit card debt I racked up doing a startup called Social
    Media Squad.I dont regret any of it.I learned so much, and it only failed because of the recession.If I had been able to ride another 4 months I would have been able to make it.
