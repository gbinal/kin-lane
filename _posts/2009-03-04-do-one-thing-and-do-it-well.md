    I have always preferred developing web applications that are simple. So many times a project gets blown out in scope and gets way too complicated. I remember specifying a site one time that I
    gave a 40K bid for. Got the project....then 6 months later through scope creep it was done and the budget was 250K. Then 6 months after launch it was abandoned because it was to complex to use.
    So I am always advocating a <a href="http://singlefunction.com/showcase/">simple tool or web application</a> that is easy for users to understand and use. Looks like there are other like minded
    individuals, here is a web application I found that showcases other "Single Function" web sites and applications. It is appropriately called <a href="http://singlefunction.com/showcase/">Single
    Function</a>.
