    I received an email from Stack Overflow today asking me to fill out a new Careers 2.0 profile today.&nbsp;After finishing I have to say, they provide a very slick process for populating my
    profile, in a meaningful way, that was very easy, and is an approach other networks need to adopt.Like any other profile I was able to add my name, link, description and tags.But then I notice
    that Iâ€™m able to connect using Github and LinkedIn.
