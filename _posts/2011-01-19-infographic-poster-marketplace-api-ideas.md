    This is another post in my API Ideas series, Im posting all my ideas for applications that could be built using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.Infographics are becoming a common way of
    condensing and visualizing large sets of data in this era of big data.You see Infographics on topics from Holiday Shopping to End of the World Predictions.One problem with digital media is can
    seem to hold less value and quickly disappear from the public eye.Printing is a great way to preserve digital media and make it more tangible and possibly more valuable.
