{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was re-reading a blog post I had starred called The Situationally Aware Business.Great post about a companies awareness of their brand, customers and world around them in real-time.I am always blown away by how ignorant many companies I work for are about their customer base, their industry, and other elements of their business.Some companies pick one competitor and are obsessed with monitoring them, while others have no benchmark of who the competitors are or what they are doing.I have worked with several companies on their social media marketing efforts, even went so far as to develop strategy for an entire social media department at one company.</p>
