    After posting about cellular and mobile barcodes yesterday I received a comment from a guy who started an online magazine on the subject. 2d-code @ <a href=
    "http://2d-code.co.uk/">http://2d-code.co.uk/</a><br />
    <br />
    From their home page about the magazine:<br />
    <p style="font-style: italic;">
      In Japan QR codes are found on everything from business cards to fresh lettuce. Now they are coming to the West and advertising and promotion will never be the same again. 2d Code will keep you
      informed as it happens, with news, views and analysis.

    I really think this is an under-realized technology and topic in this country, and if we learn from the Japanese on how they use we can solve that problem off our online / offline lives and how
    that relates to <a href="http://www.oregonlocalsearch.com">social media and online marketing campaigns</a>.
