    I strongly believe in the cloud, and more specifically in Amazons approach to cloud computing.I constantly battle people on my decision to use the cloud for my core IT infrastructure.It allows me
    to scale my infrastructure as needed and gave a completely new face to my IT strategy and operations.I can launch new server roles to meet business goals I have from scaling web servers all the
    way to launching temporary infrastructure to support large email blasts.It definitely introduces some new problems such as security, privacy, backups, etc.
