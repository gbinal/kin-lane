    So I have used Google as a platform for a while.I did several large scale social media marketing campaigns completely using Google as a platform.They just have the best software services,
    platform services, and infrastructure services.I have been finding the best route to provide a easy, but effective solution for some my mom and brothers technology platform.Google is the logical
    choice because with a domain I immediately get email, calendaring, document sharing, wiki / sites, and a dashboard.
