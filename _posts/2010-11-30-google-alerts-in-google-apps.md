Google is rapidly retooling many of the FREE applications we've come to know, and launching within the [Google Apps][1] cloud platform.

They released [Google Alerts in the Google Apps][2] area today, allowing you to setup alerts within your companies domain. <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4S6buKKlhfQ/TPU-od0Zm5I/AAAAAAAAAFE/hsE-VYcv_HI/app_sphere_alerts.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> I use [Google Alerts][3] to help me discover new information on a daily basis. The keywords and phrases I search for change from week to week depending on my focus, currently they are:

  * Print on Demand
  * Print
  * Publishing
  * Cloud Computing
  * Application Programming Interface
Google Alerts help me discover new blogs, sites and other information in these areas. It has become a primary method of discovery for me in my busy schedule, delivered in my inbox every evening. I can quickly scan the headlines to see if there are any important areas that I've missed in my daily blog consumption.

I also forgot the most important Google Alert keyword search of all: [Kin Lane][4]. The vanity search is the best use of Google Alerts, allowing you to keep in tune with whats being said about you, and your reputation in tact.

Google is rapidly [migrating their key applications such as Google Reader][5] and Google Alerts to their Google Apps platform. With the Google Apps Marketplace and these key applications now available, the platform is becoming a much more viable business cloud computing platform.
