    I am reviewing about 8 resumes that were submitted for a social media marketing consultant.I made sure that when the resumes came in I responded to each letting them know I received and were
    reviewing.Once I reviewed them all and was in the process of presenting them to the client I emailed each one personally and let them know where I was in the process.One of the applicants emailed
    me saying how he appreciated the communication.Made me think some more about this.
