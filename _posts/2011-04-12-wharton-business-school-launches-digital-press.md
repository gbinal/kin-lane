    The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and its online business journal Knowledge@Wharton has launched the Wharton Digital Press.The school is looking to position itself as an
    entrpreneurial publisher, by making its business knowledge available in multiple formats from e-books,enhancedbooks, mobile apps and print-on-demand books.The digital press will target its
    regular business audience, by focusing on management and strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, finance and investment, leadership, marketing, operations, human resources, social
    responsibility, business-government relations, and more.Wharton Digital Press will partner with authors and instead of a traditional advance, they will share the revenue from sales of the
    books.Interesting approach by a business school to take publishing to the next level by embracing electronic publishing, printing-on-demand and author revenue share models to control content and
    information on their own networks.
