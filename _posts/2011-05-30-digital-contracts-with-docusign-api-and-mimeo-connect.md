    The Internet has changed how we do business, and more specifically how we obtain signatures for client contracts.Using paper documents to finalize transactions, sending documents back and forth
    can be costly and time consuming, especially in todays fast-paced industries, with multiple partners, vendors and global work teams.The online document signature service DocuSign, lets you get
    your documents signed online, with accuracy, and saving time.DocuSign offers several electronic signature solutions for any industry, including enterprise and small business tools for Saleforce,
    Iphone and IPad, as well as an API for deeper integration.The DocuSign system allows document owners to send individual or groups of documents, identify where initials and signatures are needed.
