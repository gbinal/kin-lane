    I was watching the recent Reid Hoffman interview on Charlie Rose and they discussed the topic of which handheld he uses. He uses a Blackberry an IPhone as well as regular cell phone. Then Charlie
    Rose also said he uses the exact same configuration. They said they use:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>IPhone for web surfing
      </li>
      <li>Blackberry for Calendar, Contacts and Office functionality.
      </li>
      <li>Cell Phone for calls.
      </li>
    </ul>Its a funny balance of gadgets....and that they both are like that....wonder how many more professionals are like that. I have 2 Blackberries, just personal and business.
