    That is awesome that there are social media sites and networks starting to share the revenue with their top content generators.<br />
    <br />
    Let's go a step further. How about you pay me for all valid, professional interaction I have.<br />
    <br />
    I should be able to generate video, audio, files, pictures, etc and post them places and share in the revenue from these either being sold or ad revenue from eyeballs.<br />
    <br />
    I want to be able to take part in networks and spread the word through linking, commenting, and other forms and for every action I take it works towards and overall return in cash or other
    compensation.<br />
    <br />
    If I generate content and you make money, kick me a piece of the action.
