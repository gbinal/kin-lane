    I was just reading Setting Government Data Free with ScraperWiki from ProgrammableWeb.It led me to start playing with ScraperWiki: Scraper: a computer program that copies structured information
    from webpages into a database ScraperWiki: a website where people can write and repair public web scrapers and invent uses for the data With 20 years of experience with databases, I have love of
    data and tools that make data more accessible.Scraping is an important tool in the liberation of data from web-based sources.The data often is restricted by a lack of skills or resources by the
    owning party.They just dont have time or the understanding on how to publish the data so it is easily accessed and consumed.
