{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading Setting Government Data Free with ScraperWiki from ProgrammableWeb.It led me to start playing with ScraperWiki:

	Scraper: a computer program that copies structured information from webpages into a database
	ScraperWiki: a website where people can write and repair public web scrapers and invent uses for the data

With 20 years of experience with databases, I have love of data and tools that make data more accessible.Scraping is an important tool in the liberation of data from web-based sources.The data often is restricted by a lack of skills or resources by the owning party.They just dont have time or the understanding on how to publish the data so it is easily accessed and consumed.</p>
