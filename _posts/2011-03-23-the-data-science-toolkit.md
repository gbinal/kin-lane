Some of the tools included are[Boilerpipe][2],GeoIQ/Shuyler Erle's [Geocoder][3], and [Geodict][4].

The Data Science Toolkit is assembled by [Pete Warden][5] in an attempt to get these important data tools in the hands of more developers. The toolkit provides:

  * Independence - Never worry about the provider going offline, or charging once you're hooked.
  * Security - Run on your intranet, so customer information stays within the firewall.
  * Scalability - No API limits. Run a cluster of as many instances as you need.
You can play with a [sandbox][6] he's setup, review the [documentation][7] or grab the [VM][8] and launch an Amazon EC2 instance, using public AMI ami-9e7d8ff7.
