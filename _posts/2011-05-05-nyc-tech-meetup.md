{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was fortunate enough to attend the NY Tech Meetup last night at NYU while I was in town.Interesting to see the startup energy in NY compared with Silicon Valley.Anyways I got to see some cool startups and tech businesses:

	UberCab - The on-demand car service opens up shop in NYC.Probably not a service Id use a lot, but I like they way the intelligently used IPhone and Mapping to solve a real-life problem.Clique - Simple dating site, just within your social circles.</p>
