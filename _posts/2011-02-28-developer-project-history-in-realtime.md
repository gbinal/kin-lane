[<img src="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/Content/Img/logo-careers-2-so.png" alt="" align="right" />][1]One of my biggest complaints about the concept of a resume is that you only update it when you need a job.

If you only update your job or project history when your looking for a job, its going to go through quite a "fabrication" process.

It won't represent what happened, how you felt, and all the details of the moment won't be there.

I was building a [prototype API developer area powered by Elance API][2] today, while designing the developers detail page I listed the last 5 jobs for their Elance Profile.

This made me think about the recent release of [Stack Overflows][1], [Careers 2.0][3] developer resume tool.

Social networks like LinkedIn, and developer tools like [Github][4] are quickly become a real-time source of project and job history for developers.

I'm creating a new [projects][5] page where I'm going to try and list projects I develop in real-time. I'm going to try and work my project history into my blogging schedule as much as I can.
