{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of my biggest complaints about the concept of a resume is that you only update it when you need a job.If you only update your job or project history when your looking for a job, its going to go through quite a fabrication process.It wont represent what happened, how you felt, and all the details of the moment wont be there.I was building a prototype API developer area powered by Elance API today, while designing the developers detail page I listed the last 5 jobs for their Elance Profile.This made me think about the recent release of Stack Overflows, Careers 2.</p>
