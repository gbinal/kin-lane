Google Chrome just keeps winning me over lately. My firefox seems to crash a lot, which seems to be related to my firebug, but not always. <img class="alignnone c1" title="Google Chrome" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />

With Google Chrome in the lead with HTML 5 support, I'm spending more and more time each day using it as my primary browser. I am enjoying what [HTML 5 is doing to application development][1].

Today [Google launched improved PDF support with out plugins][2]. With all the PDF's I read, this is pretty big. Half the time my Firefox doesn't open the PDF properly. I have to download and then open locally.

Keep it up Google, I see Chrome definitely taking the lead in the browser game.
