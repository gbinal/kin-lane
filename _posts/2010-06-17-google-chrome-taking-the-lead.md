    Google Chrome just keeps winning me over lately.My firefox seems to crash a lot, which seems to be related to my firebug, but not always.With Google Chrome in the lead with HTML 5 support, Im
    spending more and more time each day using it as my primary browser.I am enjoying what HTML 5 is doing to application development.Today Google launched improved PDF support with out plugins.
