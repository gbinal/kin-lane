    Google Chrome just keeps winning me over lately. My firefox seems to crash a lot, which seems to be related to my firebug, but not always. <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title=
    "Google Chrome" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" /> With Google Chrome in the lead with HTML 5 support, I'm
    spending more and more time each day using it as my primary browser. I am enjoying what <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/html-5/">HTML 5 is doing to application development</a>. Today
    <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/bringing-improved-pdf-support-to-google.html">Google launched improved PDF support with out plugins</a>. With all the PDF's I read, this is pretty big.
    Half the time my Firefox doesn't open the PDF properly. I have to download and then open locally. Keep it up Google, I see Chrome definitely taking the lead in the browser game.
