I have been monitoring the traffic to several major technology blogs lately. This research is based upon specific domains with specific brand associate with them:

  * [TechCrunch][1]
  * <img class="alignnone c1" title="ReadWriteWeb" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/tech-blogs/ReadWriteWeb.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
  * [ReadWriteWeb][2]
  * [GigaOm][3]
  * [VentureBeat][4]
I have been evaluating their "popularity" via via several top tech news aggregation sites and social bookmarking tools:
  * [Digg][5]
  * [StumbleUpon][6]<img class="alignnone c3" title="StumbleUpon" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/social-bookmarking/stumbleupon.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
  * [Hacker News][7]
  * [DZone][7]
As well as traffic and searches at:
  * [Google][8]
  * [Yahoo][9]
  * [Windows Live][10]
While evaluating specific tag cloud patterns, specific technology, scientific, and industry topics. I have seen one major pattern.

The mainstream user, uses Internet Explorer, smart people use Firefox, and the real technology leadership uses Google Chrome.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for the comments on and offline guys. I am doing this research, but this article was actually a test in creation of titles for tech blog posts in the tech industry. I was comparing a series of posts with different titles containing a mix emotional triggers and technology triggers. Its not scientific but generally I proved that tech readers respond better to more tech with a little emotion vs. mostly emotional. It was true, an overwhelmingly large group of tech bloggers are using Firefox and Chrome, but in no way can I extract intelligence based upon this. Thanks for bearing with my slightly stupid post.
