    I have been monitoring the traffic to several major technology blogs lately.This research is based upon specific domains with specific brand associate with them: TechCrunch ReadWriteWeb GigaOm
    VentureBeat I have been evaluating their popularity via via several top tech news aggregation sites and social bookmarking tools: Digg StumbleUpon Hacker News DZone As well as traffic and
    searches at: Google Yahoo Windows Live While evaluating specific tag cloud patterns, specific technology, scientific, and industry topics.I have seen one major pattern.The mainstream user, uses
    Internet Explorer, smart people use Firefox, and the real technology leadership uses Google Chrome.UPDATE: Thanks for the comments on and offline guys.
