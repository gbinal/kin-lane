	VentureBeat

I have been evaluating their popularity via via several top tech news aggregation sites and social bookmarking tools:

	Digg

As well as traffic and searches at:

While evaluating specific tag cloud patterns, specific technology, scientific, and industry topics.I have seen one major pattern.The mainstream user, uses Internet Explorer, smart people use Firefox, and the real technology leadership uses Google Chrome.UPDATE:  Thanks for the comments on and offline guys.</p>
