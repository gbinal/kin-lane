     I have been monitoring the traffic to several major technology blogs lately. This research is based upon specific domains with specific brand associate with them:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://techcrunch.com/"
              target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>
     </li>

     <li class="c2">
          <img class="alignnone c1"
              title="ReadWriteWeb"
              src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/tech-blogs/ReadWriteWeb.PNG"
              alt=""
              width="250"
              align="right" />
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://readwriteweb.com/"
              target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a>
     </li>

          <a href="http://venturebeat.com/"
              target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     I have been evaluating their "popularity" via via several top tech news aggregation sites and social bookmarking tools:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a>
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/discover/activity/"
              target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a><img class="alignnone c3"
              title="StumbleUpon"
              src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/social-bookmarking/stumbleupon.jpg"
              alt=""
              width="150"
              align="right" />
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/"

     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/"
              target="_blank">DZone</a>
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     As well as traffic and searches at:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://www.ayhoo.com">Yahoo</a>
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://www.live.com">Windows Live</a>
     </li>
</ul>

     While evaluating specific tag cloud patterns, specific technology, scientific, and industry topics. I have seen one major pattern. The mainstream user, uses Internet Explorer, smart people use Firefox, and the real technology leadership uses Google Chrome. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Thanks for the comments on and offline guys. I am doing this research, but this article was actually a test in creation of titles for tech blog posts in the tech industry. I was comparing a series of posts with different titles containing a mix emotional triggers and technology triggers. Its not scientific but generally I proved that tech readers respond better to more tech with a little emotion vs. mostly emotional. It was true, an overwhelmingly large group of tech bloggers are using Firefox and Chrome, but in no way can I extract intelligence based upon this. Thanks for bearing with my slightly stupid post.
