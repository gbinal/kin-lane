I was just reading an article on Wired magazing called, "Google Says Mobile App Stores Have No Future". It reflects the same thought I was having last week of the importance of making sure your web application is mobile browser compatible.
I feel that mobile applications are an important development area your business should be considering, but it isn't for everyone.
If your company cannot justify the need or costs around developing a mobile application for IPhone, Blackberry, Android or other top platform you should at least make sure your web site and web application are mobile browser compliant.
Your online tools may not be the next big IPhone craze, but your customers should have the convenience of visiting your web site on their favorite mobile device using their browser.
