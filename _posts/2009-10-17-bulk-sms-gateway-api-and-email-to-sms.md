{% include JB/setup %}<p>Stumbling across several cool tools tonight. Came across this Bulk SMS Gateway.
So you can send text messages (SMS) using this API and in addition you can also send text messages using email.
The service is called TextMagic Bulk SMS Gateway.
They offer a Java, Ruby , PHP, Python, Perl code as part of their SDK to connect.
Another really cool feature is you can use the API to check the delivery status of messages you sent.
Very cool web service. I could its use come in handy in several situations. Text messaging is becoming a bigger part of events and conferences.
