Excited to have started playing with the [Google][1] [Wave Federation Protocol][1] this evening. I got my sandbox account today and played with the client available there enough....then after going through the [Google Wave API docs][2] and Google Wave Federation Protocol Draft Specs again I am eager start playing with some code.

Going to play with some on my Amazon EC2 R
