    Excited to have started playing with the <a rel="homepage" href="http://www.waveprotocol.org">Google</a> <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org">Wave Federation Protocol</a> this evening. I got my
    sandbox account today and played with the client available there enough....then after going through the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/guide.html">Google Wave API docs</a> and Google
    Wave Federation Protocol Draft Specs again I am eager start playing with some code. Going to play with some on my Amazon EC2 R&amp;D instance....then get to work on playing with a client
    some....see what damage I can do there. Exciting stuff to see where we can take this for the event industry. I downloaded <a href="http://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/stable/wiki/Home">TortoiseHG</a>
    to work with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/source/checkout">wave protocol mercurial repository</a>.
