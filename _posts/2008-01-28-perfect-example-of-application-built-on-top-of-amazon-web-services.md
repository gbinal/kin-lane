    Sonian is about to launch their new data archive services dubbed the Sonian Archive SA2.The server runs almost completely in the Amazon Cloud.It was designd to be a highly-scalable cloud
    application that specifically used four fo the Amazon Web Services:Amazon S3Amazon Ec2Simple Queue ServiceSimpleDBTheir goal of the application is to help mid-sized companies do a better job of

    application that full embraces Amazon Web Services.
