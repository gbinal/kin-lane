    I was just thinking how much information I am putting on the Internet. I pretty much migrated to a web-existence completely.<br />
    <br />
    Only think I store locally are temporary files and my music.<br />
    <br />
    I store all my thoughts in my Google Notebook, all my docs on Google Docs. This is a lot of trust. What happens if my Google Account just goes away?<br />
    <br />
    What would make me feel better about the storage of all my information not from a privacy point of view, but from a backup perspective.<br />
    <br />
    I have thought about using another Google Account and the Google API to move the data from my primary account to a secondary or backup Google Account. Would take some time but could be
    done.<br />
    <br />
    Now I am also thinking about storing at Amazon S3 or Amazon SimpleDB when ready.<br />
    <br />
    I will let everyone know when I make a move on this.
