I am doing a lot of research in applications and tools that are available out there for the event and conference industry.

I am always evaluating broad categories of event technology, but recently I am focusing on:

  * [Twitter][1]
  * [LinkedIn][2]
  * [Facebook][3]
  * [Google Wave][4]
There are limitless ways you can use these social and 2.0 tools for conferences and events. I have so much research I need to gather and organize I went ahead and lit up a new blog to store and organize.

Calling it [Events in the Clouds][5]. No theme or anything yet, just pure information.
