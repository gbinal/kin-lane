I am doing a lot of research in applications and tools that are available out there for the event and conference industry.
I am always evaluating broad categories of event technology, but recently I am focusing on:

	Twitter
	LinkedIn
	Facebook
	Google Wave

There are limitless ways you can use these social and 2.0 tools for conferences and events. I have so much research I need to gather and organize I went ahead and lit up a new blog to store and organize.
Calling it Events in the Clouds. No theme or anything yet, just pure information.
