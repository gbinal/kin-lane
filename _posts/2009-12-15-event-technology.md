    I am doing a lot of research in applications and tools that are available out there for the event and conference industry.I am always evaluating broad categories of event technology, but recently
    I am focusing on: Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google Wave There are limitless ways you can use these social and 2.0 tools for conferences and events.I have so much research I need to gather and
    organize I went ahead and lit up a new blog to store and organize.Calling it Events in the Clouds.
