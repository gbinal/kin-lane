I found a much more colorful visual of where government spending goes. It is in the UK, but still very cool.

They did a much better job visually displaying the data then I did on my [Oregon][1] or [California][2] State Budgets.

[Where Does My Money Go?][3]

Pretty cool visualizations of Government spending. I predict much more to come in 2010.
