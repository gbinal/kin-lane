    I found a much more colorful visual of where government spending goes. It is in the UK, but still very cool. They did a much better job visually displaying the data then I did on my <a href=
    "http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/">Oregon</a> or <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/">California</a> State Budgets. <a href="http://www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org/prototype/">Where Does
    My Money Go?</a> Pretty cool visualizations of Government spending. I predict much more to come in 2010.
