    People are always talking about putting your faith into the cloud.I am definitely worried about putting all my data online, and think about the repercussions of it.Now that Amazon Web Services
    have been around a while, my Amazon S3 storage account has become a central utility in my personal and business life.It is the central storage for all personal images, files, and video.I depend
    on it for business file and backup storage.
