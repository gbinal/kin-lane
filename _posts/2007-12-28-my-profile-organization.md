    In a few of my last posts I talk about organizing myself and developing a routine.One thing I am working on is creating a platform and routine that I work on everyday to help organize my world
    both internally and externally.I have started by creating an outline in Google Docs that I keep updated.This has all the elements of my world.It is pretty large so I wont list here.
