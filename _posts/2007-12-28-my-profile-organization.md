    In a few of my last posts I talk about organizing myself and developing a routine. One thing I am working on is creating a platform and routine that I work on everyday to help organize my world
    both internally and externally.<br />
    <br />
    I have started by creating an outline in Google Docs that I keep updated. This has all the elements of my world. It is pretty large so I won't list here. But it outlines everything about myself
    and what I am working on.<br />
    <br />
    I run down this outline at least once per day and and see what has changed and what needs maintenance.<br />
    <br />
    I am using Blogger to keep track of a lot of this and using it as part of the platform for tracking the data. It is one piece of how I use Google as a Content Platform.<br />
    <br />
    I will keep refining this and posting my perspective of this.
