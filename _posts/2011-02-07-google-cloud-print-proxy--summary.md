{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ok that concludes my Google Cloud Print Proxy work from the week.Ive tried to summarize the work Ive done in a series of blog posts and code samples.Here is a summary of what Ive done to date with the Google Cloud Print API:


	Google Cloud PrintIntroduction
	Google Cloud Print Services Interface (API)Introduction
	Authentication with Google Client Login
	Printer Management

	/register


	/list
	/update
	/delete




With this you should be able to create a Google Cloud Print proxy in PHP.Each sample has supporting code samples in the form of Github Gists.I will publish the entire set of code samples plus a PHP class when done.</p>
