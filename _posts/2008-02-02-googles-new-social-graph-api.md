    Google just release a social graph API out into the wild.Google crawls the Web to find publicly declared relationships between peoples accounts, just like Google crawls the Web for links between
    pages.But instead of returning links to HTML documents, the API returns JSON data structures representing the social relationships that were discovered from all the XFN and FOAF.XF stands for
    XHTML Friends Network which is a simple way to represent human relationships using hyperlinks by utilizing a simple rel= property for the hyperlink.FOAF stands for The Friend of a Friend project
    and is creating a Web of machine-readable pages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and do.
