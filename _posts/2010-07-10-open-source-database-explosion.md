    I am spending some time researching various open source and cloud computing service providers using the exhibitors list for OSCON 2010.Audrey needs some tech research done, before she attends the
    event.She wants to be prepared So Im going through each exhibitor and learning and documenting as much as I can.One thing Im seeing is an explosion of open source database offerings, Im counting
    seven systems (yes I didnt include Oracle): BlackRay - BlackRay is an innovative, fully relational in-memory database system designed to offer performance features commonly associated with search
    engines.It offers fulltext search, function based indeces, JDBC/ODBC via Postgres drivers as well as object oriented APIs.
