{% include JB/setup %}<p>I'm noticing a pattern of simple new web applications that focus on solving a single problem.
This new generation of web applications are adhering to the core principles of Software as a Service (SaaS).
They provide tools in 3 formats:

	Web Interface
	Widgets and Embeddable Objects
	Application Programming Interface (API)

The web site is simple and provides essential building blocks to support the application:

	Overview
	About
	Sign Up
	Login
	Feedback Form
	Forum
	Blog
	Privacy Policy
	Terms of Use

One example of this new breed of web applications is Crocodoc. Crocodoc allows uers to comment and annotate PDF and Word documents.
They focus on a single service through their application and deliver it in a very 2.0 way.
