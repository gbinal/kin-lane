I'm noticing a pattern of simple new web applications that focus on solving a single problem.

This new generation of web applications are adhering to the core principles of [Software as a Service][1] (SaaS).

They provide tools in 3 formats:

  * Web Interface
  * Widgets and Embeddable Objects
  * [Application Programming Interface][2] (API)
The web site is simple and provides essential building blocks to support the application:[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Crocodoc-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][3]

  * Overview
  * About
  * Sign Up
  * Login
  * Feedback Form
  * Forum
  * Blog
  * Privacy Policy
  * Terms of Use
One example of this new breed of web applications is [Crocodoc][3]. [Crocodoc][3] allows uers to comment and [annotate PDF and Word documents][4].

They focus on a single service through their application and deliver it in a very 2.0 way.
