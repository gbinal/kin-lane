{% include JB/setup %}<p>3D printing doesnt always start with a human designer or creator.There are wide variety of 3D scanners that can be used in the 3D printing process.A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance.The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D models.3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation.</p>
