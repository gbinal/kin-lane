I am conducting my cloud computing research and specifically focusing on:

	United States Federal Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing
	United States State Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing
	United States University Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing
	Definition and Understanding of Cloud Computing Players

There is a lot to read and digest around cloud computing. So I am focusing on these areas to keep my research focused and productive.
However I am starting to see a lot of posts about foreign government usage and adoption of cloud computing. Although I am hearing a lot of talk in our own federal government usage of cloud computing technologies, I am worried that we will be passed up by other governments, leaving the United States as a lesser player in the cloud computing game.
Would be devasting. We need to fund and encourage education, adoption and usage...now!
