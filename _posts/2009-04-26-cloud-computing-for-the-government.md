I am conducting my [cloud computing research][1] and specifically focusing on:

  * [United States Federal Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing][2]
  * [United States State Government Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing][3]
  * [United States University Education, Adoption, and Usage of Cloud Computing][4]
  * [Definition and Understanding of Cloud Computing Players][5]
There is a lot to read and digest around cloud computing. So I am focusing on these areas to keep my research focused and productive.

However I am starting to see a lot of posts about foreign government usage and adoption of cloud computing. Although I am hearing a lot of talk in our own federal government usage of cloud computing technologies, I am worried that we will be passed up by other governments, leaving the United States as a lesser player in the cloud computing game.

Would be devasting. We need to fund and encourage education, adoption and usage...now!
