{% include JB/setup %}<p>The amount of open data available right now can be dizzying and overwhelming.When looking through various data repositories and data marketplaces, I am trying to identify open data sets from various cities that may be of use to&nbsp;CityGrid developers.As I find data sets, that can add value to your web and mobile apps I will highlight here on the blog.Today&rsquo;s highlighted data set is from&nbsp;NYC Open Data, and provides a complete set of&nbsp;restaurant inspection results for New York City.When your users are looking for restaurants, while using your applications, it seems that knowing the restaurants latest inspection grade would be useful information in making a decision where to eat.</p>
