    have:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>
        <strong>Increased Search API Throttle</strong> - They've increased the Search API throttle by 400%.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Increased Access to Profile Data -</strong> Users who have granted access you will now get full profile data.
      </li>
    </ul>Looks like they are slowly increasing the value of their API. They seem to really take this process seriously and just rolling out features incrementally.
