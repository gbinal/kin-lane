This is a message to all you [social media][1] marketers who comment on my blog.

Thank you so much for your praise of how wonderful I am and how informative my blog is. However if your comment does not add value to my blog or your link is to relevant content I click [SPAM][2].

So don't even bother. Why waste your time and energy?

If you are not working in the technology, IT, events, web development, social media marketing, online marketing or related industry...get lost.

Your wasting your time....I filter all my comments.
