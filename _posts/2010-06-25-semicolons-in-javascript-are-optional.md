    JavaScript is a scripting language where semicolons as statement terminators are optional.I have never found a conversation about this, I just stumbled across one and found it interesting.Some of
    the points the author makes about why you should use semicolons are: Spec is cryptic and JavaScript implementations differ You cant minify JavaScript code without semicolons Its good coding style
    Semicolon insertion bites back in return statements I am pretty obsessive about using semi-colons in my JavaScript.It just makes it neat and organized in my opinion.Also keeps me in sync with my
    PHP programming as well.
