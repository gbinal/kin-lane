[<img class="alignnone c1" title="Javascript" src="http://brennan.offwhite.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/jsthegoodparts.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" align="right" />][1][JavaScript is a scripting language where semicolons as statement terminators are optional][2]. I have never found a conversation about this, I just stumbled across one and found it interesting.

Some of the points the author makes about why you should use semicolons are:

  * Spec is cryptic and JavaScript implementations differ
  * You can't minify JavaScript code without semicolons
  * It's good coding style
  * Semicolon insertion bites back in return statements
I am pretty obsessive about using semi-colons in my [JavaScript][3]. It just makes it neat and organized in my opinion. Also keeps me in sync with my PHP programming as well.
