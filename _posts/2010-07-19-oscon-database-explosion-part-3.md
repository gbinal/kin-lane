    After spending some time last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming OSCON - Open Source Convention I noticed a pattern: There is an explosion in database innovation right now I listed
    seven separate database platforms and tools that are exhibiting at the Open Source Convention.In addition to not listing Schooner Information Technology, I left out the elastic data solution
    provider: Northscale They provide a couple key tools to assist you in managing your elastic data: NorthScale Membase Server NorthScale Memcached Server Their products are based upon the memcached
    and membase open source technologies.Their servers are designed to work with existing relational database technology and expertise, and incrementally evolve toward a scale-out data architecture
    for use by web applications.They provide a developer kit to get you going.
