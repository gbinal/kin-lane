<img class="c1" title="Schooner Information Technology" src="http://info.northscale.com/rs/northscale/images/ns-logo.gif" alt="" align="right" />After spending some time last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming [OSCON - Open Source Convention][1] I noticed a pattern:

**There is an [explosion in database innovation][2] right now** I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. In addition to not listing [Schooner Information Technology][3], I left out the elastic data solution provider:

**[Northscale**][4] They provide a couple key tools to assist you in managing your elastic data:

  * [NorthScale Membase Server][5]
  * [NorthScale Memcached Server][6]
Their products are based upon the [memcached][7] and [membase][8] open source technologies. Their servers are designed to work with existing relational database technology and expertise, and incrementally evolve toward a scale-out data architecture for use by web applications.

They provide a [developer kit][9] to get you going.
