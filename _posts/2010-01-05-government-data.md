{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am going through the 2009-2011 Governor's Recommended Budget for Oregon. I can get at some pretty good PDF docuemtns with information on budget. Good data in there.
Problem is I can't get it in any digestable format. XML? CSV? Excel? JSON?
Someday all city, state and federal governments will have to publish all of their data via API.
Luckily in Adobe PDF Reader I can just highlight the tabular data, right click and and export to spreadsheet.</p>
