Amazon Web Services finally added an [S3 Bucket explorer to the Amazon Console][1]. I was mentioning last week about how mature the offerings in the AWS console are getting, and how the the whole suite of [Amazon Web Services is ready for use by Small Business][2]. [<img class="c1" title="Amazon Console - S3" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/Console-S3.PNG" alt="" width="300" align="right" />][3]

The Amazon S3 interface is pretty simple, but then again it is simple storage. With this addition you can easily manage your:

  * Servers and Process Power with [Amazon EC2][4]
  * Raw Object / File storage (PDF, doc, jpg, gif, png, etc.) with [Amazon S3][5]
  * International content delivery for PDF, Images, Video, Audio using [Amazon Cloudfront][6]
  * Simple and Releational Database Storage with [Amazon SimpleDB][7] and [Amazon RDS][8]
  * Scaling with Amazon [Elastic Load Balancing][9] and [Autoscaling][10]
All of this is available through the Amazon Console. Amazon is the leader when it come to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and has long been driving cloud applications in the SaaS and PaaS space.

I think as the Amazon Console matures you will see more [small business IT managers and owners adopting Amazon cloud services][2].
