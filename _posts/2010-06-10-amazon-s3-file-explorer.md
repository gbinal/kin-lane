    Amazon Web Services finally added an S3 Bucket explorer to the Amazon Console.I was mentioning last week about how mature the offerings in the AWS console are getting, and how the the whole suite
    of Amazon Web Services is ready for use by Small Business.The Amazon S3 interface is pretty simple, but then again it is simple storage.With this addition you can easily manage your: Servers and
    Process Power with Amazon EC2 Raw Object / File storage (PDF, doc, jpg, gif, png, etc.) with Amazon S3 International content delivery for PDF, Images, Video, Audio using Amazon Cloudfront Simple
    and Releational Database Storage with Amazon SimpleDB and Amazon RDS Scaling with Amazon Elastic Load Balancing and Autoscaling All of this is available through the Amazon Console.
