After I finished reading it I noticed they had a download as PDF or XML, and it also had an EzReprint link, which takes to a page hosted by[Odyssey Press][4], that allows you to print one or more copies of the article in color or black and white, and choose a cover.

I am working to make it as easy as possible to publish a "print now" button to any site, just by providing the URL of a PDF for any document you wish to print.

We currently have[print widgets that you can deploy on your own site][6], using PHP, but we still do not have any plug and play widgets that make printing of articles and whitepapers easy. I am rolling out four new APIs in the coming weeks that will make our print now widgets, easier to embed on and website or application.
