    I was reading an article today called, What Do I Want from the Publisher of the Future?on PLoS computational Biology, apeer-reviewed open-acccess journalpublished by thePublic Library of
    Science.After I finished reading it I noticed they had a download as PDF or XML, and it also had an EzReprint link, which takes to a page hosted byOdyssey Press, that allows you to print one or
    more copies of the article in color or black and white, and choose a cover.This is exactly what you can do withMimeo Connect.I am working to make it as easy as possible to publish a print now
    button to any site, just by providing the URL of a PDF for any document you wish to print.
