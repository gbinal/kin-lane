    I just got back from France this week where I was attending API Days in Paris.I thoroughly enjoyed many deep discussions with folks about big data and APIs, coming home with what I feel is a
    pretty clear difference between the US approach and the potential EU approach to APIs and big data.I’ve definitely seen an awakening within Europe when it comes to APIs in the last couple of
    months.It wasn’t just because of this event.I think government and businesses in Europe are seeing the success in the US and genuinely want to understand how they can actively participate in the
    coming API driven economy.
