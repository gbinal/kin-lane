    This topic got me blogging again on my personal blog at least. I recently migrated from Outlook...for good.<br />
    <br />
    This doesn't seem like much, but I have been using outlook since I think 1998. It has been the cornerstone of my online communication for years. I have each year in a PSD back to 2002.<br />
    <br />
    I finally just wanted to get machine independent and I've made the jump to Gmail full time.<br />
    <br />
    We'll see where it goes, so far so good.
