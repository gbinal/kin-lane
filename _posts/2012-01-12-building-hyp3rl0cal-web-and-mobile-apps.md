    I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;CityGrid API&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States.&nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so
    I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGridâ€™s&nbsp;places,&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;offers&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;web, mobile and custom
    advertising&nbsp;we offer.So I created&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal, my playground for all things local.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs,
    while also telling the story of what I build in real-time.&nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;download and fork on Github, and
    even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.
