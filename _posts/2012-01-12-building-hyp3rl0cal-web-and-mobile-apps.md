{% include JB/setup %}<p>I needed a way to tell the story of the&nbsp;CityGrid API&nbsp;from the perspective of cities across the United States. &nbsp;The way I tell stories is through programming and hacking on APIs, so I needed a project that would allow me to hack on CityGrid&rsquo;s&nbsp;places,&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;offers&nbsp;as well as play with different ways of using the&nbsp;web, mobile and custom advertising&nbsp;we offer.
So I created&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal, my playground for all things local. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal gives me a place to publish projects that I hack on using the CityGrid APIs, while also telling the story of what I build in real-time. &nbsp;You can find local applications I build in a variety of languages, complete with links to&nbsp;download and fork on Github, and even in some cases I publish Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with the code already loaded and ready to use.
As the API Evangelist at CityGrid I will be touring around the country attending hackathons and conferences, &nbsp;spreading the word about CityGrid, and interacting with developers in different cities. &nbsp;Each city I visit, I will launch a copy of my local directory prototype for that city, and publish to Hyp3rL0cal. &nbsp;This will allow me to see the quality of data available via CityGrid APIs for each city and community I visit.
I have added a&nbsp;blog to Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;where I will tell the story of my projects and travels around the country evangelizing about&nbsp;CityGrid. &nbsp;Come back often, I hope this will be as much of a learning experience for you, as it is for me.</p>
