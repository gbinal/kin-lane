    Im getting a little annoyed by Microsoft using my name in their new products.A while back they released their mobile technology and platform targeting the youth, called Kin.(taking a pretty sweet
    domain name) Now today Ive read that Microsoft will be renaming their gaming controller project Natal to Kinect.They havent talked to me about any of this.So Im going to be a spoiler and leak
    information on their next two projects: Microsoft Kinetic - An web based green power technology project that is meant to compete with Google Powermeter.
