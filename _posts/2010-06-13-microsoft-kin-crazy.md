{% include JB/setup %}<p>I'm getting a little annoyed by Microsoft using my name in their new products. A while back they released their mobile technology and platform targeting the youth, called Kin. (taking a pretty sweet domain name)
Now today I've read that Microsoft will be renaming their gaming controller project Natal to Kinect. They haven't talked to me about any of this.
So I'm going to be a spoiler and leak information on their next two projects:

	Microsoft Kinetic - An web based green power technology project that is meant to compete with Google Powermeter. It measures the electricity generated when Kin users rub their bodies together.
	Microsoft Next of Kin - A social networking notification tool that notifies everyone you that your are dead. (when you die of course)

Maybe in the future Microsoft could work with me more on their product launches so I wouldn't have to be such a spoiler.</p>
