    I feel I have a decent perspective of riding the waves of technological change, wisdom that has come from playing in the Internet world from day one.We have to make certain commitments regarding
    our career or as application architects when it comes to specific platforms, technology or programming languages.I drank the Microsoft Kool-Aid for a long time.Eventually in 2005 I started
    migrating to a more open-source frame of mind.This migration pushed me into learning new programming languages such as PHP, Python, and Ruby.
