I've been paying attention to the [Google Cloud Print][1] project at Google Code. With Google Cloud Print you can:

  * Register any printer to be accessible via the Internet for printing by authorized users
  * Allow authorized users to print to this device with multiple devices (desktop, laptop, mobile phone)
Seem like as a business owner I would be able to temporarily open up my printer for a client, vendor or customer and allow printing. Then the person printing could send a document straight to the printer without actually sharing any digital files.[<img src="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/images/overview.gif" alt="" align="right" />][1]

**Would this make documents more secure?**

I could send only printed copies to someone I wanted to view my document. Since it was transmitted over the web, the document transmission could be logged showing that a single print copy license was delivered to this business at this address.

Seems like it could add a new layer to secure document sharing.
