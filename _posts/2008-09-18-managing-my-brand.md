{% include JB/setup %}<p>So I am always working to get a better handle on how people view me and my personal brand.  My brand consists of my profile, work experience, technologies, blog, pics and just the general image of how people view me personally and professionally online.
Maintaining my brand is a full time job and I do not always achieve the results I want.  When people look for me they usually start at Google, so this is where I start.
The first two pages of Google search for my name is where I start.  I have a unique brand so I dominate the first two pages.  These are the sites where I come up on the these pages:

	KinLane.com
	Classroom 2.0
	Blogger
	Fast Company
	Facebook
	Naymz
	Ning
	Mashable
	Flickr
	Twitter
	Businesscard2
	Bebo
	Plaxo
	LookupAnyone

A couple other notable networks I feel are necessary to focus on even though they aren't in the top Google results:

	MySpace
	LinkedIn

Now these results fluctuate based upon Google's indexes and I add relevant sites from time to time to my maintenance list.
In an effort to maintain my brand I try to keep an active presence and profile on these social network and social media sites.
It is a full time job, I am working on a process and requirements needed to maintain each area so that I can have a systematic approach for each day and each week on what I should be doing.
I will publish the approach to each network and its maintenance as I formalize.  This is a work in progress and I will keep updating this post with links to updated information.</p>
