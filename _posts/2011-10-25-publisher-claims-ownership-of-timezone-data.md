    Ive been following the latest copyrightinfringementlawsuit againstArthur Olson, a computer scientist at the National Institutes of Health, and Paul Eggert, a computer scientist at the University
    of California at Los Angeles.Astrolabe, an Astrology site claims theyhave unlawfully reproduced the works and distributed them without their permission.According to Wired.com, Astrolabes federal
    lawsuit, filed last week, is among the boldest claims of copyright infringement since 2005.Thats when Bikram Choudhury, the hot-yoga guru, claimed copyright to his yoga positions.
