I am going through [Diggs new API][1] to see what added benefit it brings to the table. [Digg][2] usually is lower on the radar of many of my clients when it comes to sharing their news and information.

Although it definitely can come into play pretty quickly.

So I am curious what the new benefits the new [Digg API][1] brings to event managers and other potential clients.
