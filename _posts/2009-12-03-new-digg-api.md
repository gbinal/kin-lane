     I am going through <a href="http://apidoc.digg.com/">Diggs new API</a> to see what added benefit it brings to the table. <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> usually is lower on the radar of many of my clients when it comes to sharing their news and information. Although it definitely can come into play pretty quickly. So I am curious what the new benefits the new <a href="http://apidoc.digg.com/">Digg API</a> brings to event managers and other potential clients.
