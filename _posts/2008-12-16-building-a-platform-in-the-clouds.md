    I am currently taking a company and reconstructing its entire server and infrastructure platform to operate in the clouds. It is a lot of planning, work and just readjustment in thinking on how
    to deploy a server infrastructure. However it is so worth it. It is such a more scalable and resilient platform than depending on your own server infrastructure. I will be outlining more about
    how and why I am doing this as I get time. Its been a while since I posted because I have been so busy. More to come...
