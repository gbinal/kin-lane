{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am currently taking a company and reconstructing its entire server and infrastructure platform to operate in the clouds.It is a lot of planning, work and just readjustment in thinking on how to deploy a server infrastructure.However it is so worth it.It is such a more scalable and resilient platform than depending on your own server infrastructure.I will be outlining more about how and why I am doing this as I get time.</p>
