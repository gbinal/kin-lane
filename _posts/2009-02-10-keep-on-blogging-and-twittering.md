{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am finding renewed energy for blogging and twittering lately.mostly because I have more time on my hands living way out in the woods.I used to really worry about the traffic to my blog and building a following, etc.That really gets in the way.If I just focus on what I am working on and what is important to me it seems to work better.</p>
