    One thing Im really enjoying with all the web 2.0, social, cloudy, mobile goodness that is going on these days is the general democratization of computing.Cheap computers, mobile phones and cloud
    computing puts computing power in everyone hand.Even though Ive spent the last 20 years programming and running servers, I dont feel like a computer programmer.I feel like Ive hacked most of it.
