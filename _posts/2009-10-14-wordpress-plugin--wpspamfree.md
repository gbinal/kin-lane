    I started getting more traffic to my blog lately and with that came a bunch of SPAM.I dealt with for about a month than I began searching for a solution.Of course the Wordpress Plugin directory
    is where to go.I cam across the highly rated Wordpress WP-SpamFree plugin.I highly recommend it, it took care of my SPAM issues and so far Ive only seen a handful of real comments.
