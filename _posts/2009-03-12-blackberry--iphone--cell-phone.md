    I was watching the recent Reid Hoffman interview on Charlie Rose and they discussed the topic of which handheld he uses.He uses a Blackberry an IPhone as well as regular cell phone.Then Charlie
    Rose also said he uses the exact same configuration.They said they use: IPhone for web surfing Blackberry for Calendar, Contacts and Office functionality.Cell Phone for calls.
