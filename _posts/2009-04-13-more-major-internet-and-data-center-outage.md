    Was just reading this post about a <a href="http://www.cloudave.com/link/left-in-the-dark">major Australian Internet outage</a> that left the entire top end of the country without telephone,
    internet or mobile communications for about 10 hours. Definitely brings attention to a MAJOR problem we will continue facing with our nations infrastructure. I wrote about the <a href=
    "http://www.kinlane.com/?p=514">outage in San Jose the other day</a>, that affected our company. There needs to be more auditing of our infrastructure and development of redundant fiber rings as
    well as make sure data center providers build in redundancy between data centers.
