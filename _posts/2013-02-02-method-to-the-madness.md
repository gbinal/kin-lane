     I'm always working to find a way to organize my world, to help me better keep track of my wealth of content and information, while also assisting people in navigating my sometimes chaotic world of sites, blogs and projects.
</p>
<p>
     To help organize this, I'm breaking my navigation on KinLane.com into two main groups.  The first area is overview information about my world in the following sections:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li class="page_item current_page_item">
          <a title="Home" href="/index.php">Blog</a> - My personal thoughts and random observations in blog form
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="About" href="/about/">About</a> - My official bio that I use across most of my profile, which changes each year
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Research" href="/research.php">Research</a> - Any areas I'm currently researching or looking to research in the near future
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Projects" href="/projects.php">Projects</a> - Projects that I've completed and made publicly available (hopefully on Github)
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Talks" href="/talks.php">Talks</a> - Some video and slideshows from talks that I've given
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Talks" href="/images.php">Images</a> - A variety of logos, photos and drawings from across my world as API Evangelist
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Mission" href="/mission.php">Mission</a> - The mission statement for my evangelism platform
     </li>
     <li class="page_item page-item-2">
          <a title="Contact" href="/contact/">Contact</a> - Various ways you can get a hold of me
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The second area is providing links to all my main properties:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a> - Business of APIs
     </li>

     </li>
     <li>

     </li>
     <li>

     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     When you google my name, KinLane.com comes up first.  So I want to make sure and provide one click access to everything I have going on.  
</p>
<p>
     I will adjust this from time to time, and work to keep each of these sections up to date as things shift.
