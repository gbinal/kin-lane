{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im always working to find a way to organize my world, to help me better keep track of my wealth of content and information, while also assisting people in navigating my sometimes chaotic world of sites, blogs and projects.To help organize this, Im breaking my navigation on KinLane.com into two main groups.&nbsp;The first area is overview information about my world in the following sections:

Blog&nbsp;- My personal thoughts and random observations in blog form
About&nbsp;- My official bio that I use across most of my profile, which changes each year
Research&nbsp;- Any areas Im currently researching or looking to research in the near future
Projects&nbsp;- Projects that Ive completed and made publicly available (hopefully on Github)
Talks&nbsp;- Some video and slideshows from talks that Ive given
Images&nbsp;- A variety of logos, photos and drawings from across my world as API Evangelist
Mission&nbsp;- The mission statement for my evangelism platform
Contact&nbsp;- Various ways you can get a hold of me

The second area is providing links to all my main properties:

API Evangelist&nbsp;- Business of APIs
API Voice&nbsp;- Politics of APIs
API Stack&nbsp;- My ranking system for the API space
Hack Weekends&nbsp;- A resource site focused on hackathons
IPA Evangelist&nbsp;- My personal blogging about my love of IPAs
Hacker Storytelling&nbsp;- A format Im using in 2013 to make my projects open and machine readable by default

When you google my name, KinLane.com comes up first.</p>
