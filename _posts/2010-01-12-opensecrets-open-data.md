    I love data. When I find great sources of data I have to record it. Here is RAW and API data from the Federal Government. <strong><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/action/data.php">OpenSecrets
    Open Data</a></strong> It has:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Campaign Finance - PAC and individual contributions to, and expenditures by, Candidates, PACs and Party Committees
      </li>
      <li>Lobbying - Clients, registrants (generally lobbying firms), lobbyists and bills lobbied
      </li>
      <li>527s Data - Committees, Receipts and Expenditures
      </li>
      <li>Personal Finances - Agreements, Assets and Liabilities, Outside Compensation and Income, Honoraria and Gifts, Positions, Transactions, Travel
      </li>
      <li>Resource tables such as Category Codes, Expense Codes, Members of Congress, etc
