I love data. When I find great sources of data I have to record it.

Here is RAW and API data from the Federal Government.

**[OpenSecrets Open Data][1]**

It has:

  * Campaign Finance - PAC and individual contributions to, and expenditures by, Candidates, PACs and Party Committees
  * Lobbying - Clients, registrants (generally lobbying firms), lobbyists and bills lobbied
  * 527s Data - Committees, Receipts and Expenditures
  * Personal Finances - Agreements, Assets and Liabilities, Outside Compensation and Income, Honoraria and Gifts, Positions, Transactions, Travel
  * Resource tables such as Category Codes, Expense Codes, Members of Congress, etc
Good stuff. I will start working through this data.
