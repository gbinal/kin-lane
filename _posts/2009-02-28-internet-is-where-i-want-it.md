    I remember back in 2001 right after my daughter was born I was building a house in Southern Oregon and decided to spend part of the summer traveling around Oregon.So I setup my laptop as a server
    so I could still work while I was travelling.Then I had a dial-up modem for my laptop.I would get 9-18k.After building the house in Southern Oregon and the crash was well under way I had to move
    back to Eugene and find a job.
