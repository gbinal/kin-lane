    I remember back in 2001 right after my daughter was born I was building a house in Southern Oregon and decided to spend part of the summer traveling around Oregon. So I setup my laptop as a
    server so I could still work while I was travelling. Then I had a dial-up modem for my laptop. I would get 9-18k. After building the house in Southern Oregon and the crash was well under way I
    had to move back to Eugene and find a job. I was crashing in my VW bus around Eugene and tapping Internet from the University of Oregon and select wifi hotspots that were around (very few).
    Tonight I was getting ready to do some bundling of Amazon EC2 Instances and my Internet just went down. So I went ahead and tethered to my Verizon Blackberry and connected to the Internet. I was
    curious what sort of speed I was getting. So I am getting 870K down and 98K up here in Blue River Oregon over my cell phone. I'm out in the sticks. The Internet is slowly getting where I want it.
