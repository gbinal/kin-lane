Every once in a while I like to take inventory of my personal IT platform. It helps me pull together all the tools I use to "make the magic happen". Here is a current break down:
Communication

	Gmail
	Skype
	GTalk

Ideas, Documents, Collaboration

	Google Calendar
	Google Docs
	Google Sites
	Evernote

CRM

	Gist
	Google Contact

Social

	Tweetdeck
	Twitter
	Facebook
	Google Buzz
	LinkedIn

Other

	Google Reader
	Skype
	Amazon Console
	Wordpress - kinlane.com
	Jungle Disk - Amazon S3
	Cloudberry Explorer - Amazon S3
	Woopra
	Aptana
	Google Chrome
	Firefox
	Internet Explorer 8

There are other tools I use secondarily, but this reflects what I use religiously on a day to day basis. This helps me stay organized and focused.
