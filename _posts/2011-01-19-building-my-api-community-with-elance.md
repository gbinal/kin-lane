{% include JB/setup %}<p>I'm building the API area for the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API currently. When it is ready, I will need developers.
I will need developers to write code samples, working on internal projects and be available to work on partner projects.
I can't wait to build momentum and attract developers. I need developers now!
I'm working on a strategy to build my community using the Elance expert community. It is a ready to go community of developers.

I'm working on some tools for:

	Browsing Developers
	Searching Developers
	Viewing Developer Profiles
	Feature Developers
	Allow Developers to Connect Their Mimeo API Account with their Elance Account
	Integrate the Mimeo Cloud Print API Community with a Mimeo Elance Developer Group

I'm also working on other ways I can use Elance to build my API community:

	Contests - Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print APIcontests.
	Hackathons - Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print API Hackathons.

	Elance Groups - Establishing an Elance Group for the Mimeo Cloud Print API.
	Skills - Work to establish existing Elance skills needed, as well as establish new sets of skills.

I don't suffer from "Build It and They Will Come" Syndrome, I know the success of my API community depends on developers, and I need highly skilled ones right away. Elance seems like the best way to tap an existing community of skilled developer talent and seed my own API community.</p>
