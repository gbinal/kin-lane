I'm building the [API][1] area for the [Mimeo][2] Connect [Cloud Print][3] API currently. When it is ready, I will need developers.

I will need developers to write code samples, working on internal projects and be available to work on partner projects.

I can't wait to build momentum and attract developers. I need developers now!

I'm working on a strategy to build my community using the [Elance expert community][4]. It is a ready to go community of developers. [<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][2] I'm working on some tools for:

  * Browsing Developers
  * Searching Developers
  * Viewing Developer Profiles
  * Feature Developers
  * Allow Developers to Connect Their Mimeo API Account with their Elance Account
  * Integrate the Mimeo Cloud Print [API Community][1] with a Mimeo Elance Developer Group
I'm also working on other ways I can use Elance to build my API community:
  * [Contests][5] \- Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print APIcontests.
  * Hackathons - Solicit Elance developer involvement in Mimeo Cloud Print API Hackathons.
  * [<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/elance/elance-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][4]
  * Elance Groups - Establishing an Elance Group for the Mimeo Cloud Print API.
  * Skills - Work to establish existing Elance skills needed, as well as establish new sets of skills.
I don't suffer from "Build It and They Will Come" Syndrome, I know the success of my API community depends on developers, and I need highly skilled ones right away. Elance seems like the best way to tap an existing community of skilled developer talent and seed my own API community.
