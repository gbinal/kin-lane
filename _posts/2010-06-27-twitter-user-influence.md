{% include JB/setup %}<p>When harvesting thousands of Twitter profiles and evaluating them at a macro level.you really have to come up with a definition of what is a quality or influential Twitter user.What makes a Twitter user influential:

	Number of Followers
	Number of Retweets
	Number of Tweets
	Contextual relevance of Tweets
