    I started following the Dalia Lhama on Twitter today.He already has 11K followers and they seem overwhelmed by the response somewhat.You can follow the Dalai Lhama at http://twitter.com/ohhdl I
    had a funny thought as I was following.Not saying the Dalai Lhama has any relation or similiarities to God, but in my limited religious experience when I was a kid I envisioned praying very much
    like Twitter.
