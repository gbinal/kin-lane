{% include JB/setup %}<p>I came across a cloud backup tool the other day called backupify.It runs in the cloud and backs up your cloud.Very cool.backupify is pretty easy to setup.It acts like most social aggregators like Friendfeed, however it then backs up your data rather than syndicating it or providing a single feed.</p>
