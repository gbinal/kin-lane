    Amazon Web Services experienced an outage this morning across all their systems. There is a flurry of posts on this forum about the <a href=
    "http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=19714&amp;tstart=0">Amazon Web Services Outage</a>.<br />
    <br />
    This is the first actual outage I have seen or heard of on the Amazon Web Services Platform. Definitely a black eye for Amazon Web Services and building credibility with the community to use them
    as the core of their networks.<br />
    <br />
    Gives some fuel to the argument that no matter what infrastructure you use that you should have a Plan B.<br />
    <br />
    There were some really scared and frustrated people out there questioning their business models.<br />
    <br />
    I really hope Amazon can recover from this, I really have been pushing AWS and evangelizing with various clients.
