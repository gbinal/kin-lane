Amazon Web Services experienced an outage this morning across all their systems.  There is a flurry of posts on this forum about the Amazon Web Services Outage.This is the first actual outage I have seen or heard of on the Amazon Web Services Platform.  Definitely a black eye for Amazon Web Services and building credibility with the community to use them as the core of their networks.Gives some fuel to the argument that no matter what infrastructure you use that you should have a Plan B.There were some really scared and frustrated people out there questioning their business models. I really hope Amazon can recover from this, I really have been pushing AWS and evangelizing with various clients.
