    I was setting up a demonstration event web site to show how events can become more social.I setup new accounts for the event at Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.Facebook has their Fanbox tool that
    easily allows you to build a widget or badge to showcase your Facebook page on your web site.Twitter has their profile widget that quickly puts your Twitter stream on your web site.LinkedIn just
    has their promote your profile buttons.
