     <a href="http://64.74.98.87">LinkedIn finally opened up their API</a> to the world. It gives you authentication, profile, and network access to LinkedIn Profiles. It is definitely a step forward. Unfortunately I am looking for access to the events, question and answer, and group access through the API as well. Also I would like access to the LinkedIn application platform too! I guess I want the world, but access to the profiles is a start. LinkedIn seems to be way behind the competition in this area. It is either really a lot of work for them or they are just being very very cautious in their approach.
