[LinkedIn finally opened up their API][1] to the world. It gives you authentication, profile, and network access to LinkedIn Profiles.

It is definitely a step forward. Unfortunately I am looking for access to the events, question and answer, and group access through the API as well.

Also I would like access to the LinkedIn application platform too! I guess I want the world, but access to the profiles is a start.

LinkedIn seems to be way behind the competition in this area. It is either really a lot of work for them or they are just being very very cautious in their approach.
