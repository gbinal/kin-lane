    So I jumped the gun and blogged about the new Amazon DevPay web service and realized I hadnt even mentioned the other latest release from Amazon, the SimpleDB.This is something I have been
    waiting for.I was already utilizing Amazon S3 for heavy storage of files, images, and large text blobs.I use MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server for most back-end databases, however 90% of the time I
    am using only about 10% of the capabilities available to me.I am looking to add, update, and delete text and numeric data is very small amounts most of the time.
