    When I am asked to save something on the internet when using an web application or desktop application I want to asked where?<br />
    <br />
    I want to save it to a public location as part of my profile.<br />
    <br />
    I want to save it to a privation location as part of my profile either in my online environment or in a local environment. A local logical drive.<br />
    <br />
    This should be part of everything I do on the Internet, I sho<a href="javascript:void(0)" tabindex="10" onclick="return false;"></a>uld have to think too hard about it.<br />
    <br />
    Should just flow and be where I put it.
