When I am asked to save something on the internet when using an web application or desktop application I want to asked where?

I want to save it to a public location as part of my profile.

I want to save it to a privation location as part of my profile either in my online environment or in a local environment. A local logical drive.

This should be part of everything I do on the Internet, I should have to think too hard about it.

Should just flow and be where I put it.
