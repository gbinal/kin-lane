Emphasis is on large complex data sets such as those in very large databases or through web mining. Topics: decision trees, neural networks, association rules, clustering, case based methods, and data visualization. The following chapters from the textbook will be covered in this order:

  * Chapter 1 - Introduction
  * Chapter 2 - Data
  * Chapter 3 - Exploring Data
  * Chapter 6 - Association Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms
  * Chapter 4 - Classification: Basic Concepts, Decision Trees, and Model Evaluation
  * Chapter 5 - Classification: Alternative Techniques (naive bayes models, support vector machines)
  * Chapter 8 - Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms
  * Chapter 10 - Anomaly Detection
