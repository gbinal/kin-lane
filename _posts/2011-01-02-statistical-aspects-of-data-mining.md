    Course Description: Data mining is used to discover patterns and relationships in data.Emphasis is on large complex data sets such as those in very large databases or through web mining.Topics:
    decision trees, neural networks, association rules, clustering, case based methods, and data visualization.The following chapters from the textbook will be covered in this order: Chapter 1 -
    Introduction Chapter 2 - Data Chapter 3 - Exploring Data Chapter 6 - Association Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms Chapter 4 - Classification: Basic Concepts, Decision Trees, and Model
    Evaluation Chapter 5 - Classification: Alternative Techniques (naive bayes models, support vector machines) Chapter 8 - Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms Chapter 10 - Anomaly
    Detection Course Schedule and Lecture Notes in PDF format from Stanford for Statistical Aspects of Data Mining.
