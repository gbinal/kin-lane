{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading a great testimonial of moving your business to Google Apps. I use Google Apps as a starting point for all my domains, right after purchasing the domain.
Reasons for moving your business to the Google Apps Cloud:

	All Your Data is Backed Up
	Share Your Documents
	Share Your Calendar
	Increased Efficiency
	Reduce SPAM
	Real-Time Web Site Integration
	Search
	Easy administration and low cost
	Accessible anywhere

There are many ways to improve Google Apps, but it is a great start for your virtual office on the Internet. It is a critical part of me doing business on the Internet.</p>
