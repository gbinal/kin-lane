<img class="alignnone c1" title="Google Apps" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/googleapps.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />I was just reading a great [testimonial of moving your business to Google Apps][1]. I use [Google Apps][2] as a starting point for all my domains, right after purchasing the domain.

Reasons for moving your business to the Google Apps Cloud:

  * All Your Data is Backed Up
  * Share Your Documents
  * Share Your Calendar
  * Increased Efficiency
  * Reduce SPAM
  * Real-Time Web Site Integration
  * Search
  * Easy administration and low cost
  * Accessible anywhere
There are many ways to improve Google Apps, but it is a great start for your virtual office on the Internet. It is a critical part of me doing business on the Internet.
