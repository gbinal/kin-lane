    To kick-off my role as API Evangelist at CityGrid, I took a quick walk through the world of location and places API.The CityGrid API centers around places API which provides rich local business
    data via a RESTful API.So getting familiar with other location and places API is critical to my role.While going through each of these APIs in the space I flushed out what Id consider the high
    levels areas that these APIs offer.This list is a work in progress, with a goal in helping see the industry, and potentially identify where players are leading the industry, and where there are
    gaps.
