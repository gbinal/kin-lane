     I wanted a way to make the rich content available via CityGrid APIs accessible to anyone, even if you weren't a developer. CityGrid has some great iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications. I've also built some samples and starter kits for building local web applications in PHP, Python and Ruby. WordPress seemed like the perfect next step to reach a larger audience, so I took the PHP Hyp3rL0cal directory that uses CityGrid Places API, and deployed it as a Wordpress Plugin. Now you can launch a quick section on your Wordpress blog or site that allows you to display businesses for your area, in whatever category you wish. This CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin is meant to be a project that developers can learn from and even deploy their own local WordPress Plugins that use CityGrid APIs.  However its completely functional and could be deployed by any non-developer as well. Right now you can download or fork at Github, as I stabilize it further I will publish to the CityGrid developer center code samples page. If you have any questions or need help, visit the CityGrid Developer Forums or ping us on Twitter via @citygridapiteam.
