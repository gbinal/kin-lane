I wanted a way to make the rich content available via&nbsp;CityGrid APIs&nbsp;accessible to anyone, even if you weren't a developer.
CityGrid has some great&nbsp;iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications.
I've also built some&nbsp;samples and starter kits for building local web applications in&nbsp;PHP, Python and Ruby.
WordPress seemed like the perfect next step to reach a larger audience, so I took the PHP&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;directory that uses&nbsp;CityGrid Places API, and deployed it as a Wordpress Plugin.
Now you can launch a quick section on your Wordpress blog or site that allows you to display businesses for your area, in whatever category you wish.
This&nbsp;CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin&nbsp;is meant to be a project that developers can learn from and even deploy their own local WordPress Plugins that use CityGrid APIs. &nbsp;However its completely functional and could be deployed by any non-developer as well.
Right now you can&nbsp;download or fork at Github, as I stabilize it further I will publish to the&nbsp;CityGrid developer center code samples page.
If you have any questions or need help, visit the&nbsp;CityGrid Developer Forums&nbsp;or ping us on Twitter via&nbsp;@citygridapiteam.
