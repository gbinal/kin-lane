<img class="alignnone" title="CityGrid Logo" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/citygrid_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I wanted a way to make the rich content available via [CityGrid APIs][1] accessible to anyone, even if you weren't a developer.

CityGrid has some great [iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications][2].

I've also built some [samples and starter kits for building local web applications in PHP, Python and Ruby][3].

WordPress seemed like the perfect next step to reach a larger audience, so I took the PHP [Hyp3rL0cal][4] directory that uses [CityGrid Places API][5], and deployed it as a Wordpress Plugin.

<img class="alignnone" title="CityGrid Logo" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/citygrid/CityGrid.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Now you can launch a quick section on your Wordpress blog or site that allows you to display businesses for your area, in whatever category you wish.

This [CityGrid Hyp3rL0cal Wordpress Plugin][6] is meant to be a project that developers can learn from and even deploy their own local WordPress Plugins that use CityGrid APIs.  However its completely functional and could be deployed by any non-developer as well.

Right now you can [download or fork at Github][7], as I stabilize it further I will publish to the [CityGrid developer center code samples page][8].

If you have any questions or need help, visit the [CityGrid Developer Forums][9] or ping us on Twitter via [@citygridapiteam][10].
