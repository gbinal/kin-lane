Just came across good [introductory look at the HTC Hero][1] from [Techcrunch][2]. I think this is just the beginning of a wave of [Android][3] based mobile phones and webbooks you will see over the next year or two.

2009 will be a big year for new mobile phones and webbooks to be released based upon the Android platform. Which I think will make 2010 definitely a big year for [Android application development][4].

All this platform buzz and Android development buzzed started for me at Google IO this year. Definitely an exciting time for mobile application development.
