{% include JB/setup %}<p>Just came across good introductory look at the HTC Hero from Techcrunch.I think this is just the beginning of a wave of Android based mobile phones and webbooks you will see over the next year or two.2009 will be a big year for new mobile phones and webbooks to be released based upon the Android platform.Which I think will make 2010 definitely a big year for Android application development.All this platform buzz and Android development buzzed started for me at Google IO this year.</p>
