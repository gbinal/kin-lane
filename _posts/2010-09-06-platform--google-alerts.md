{% include JB/setup %}I spend time each week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business. One of the goals of this platform definition is to assist in my migration to the cloud.
I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked. I use Google Alerts to discover new information on blogs, search, and other discussions.
I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:

	Amazon Web Services
	Amazon EC2
	Amazon S3
	Application Programming Interface
	API
	Cloud Computing
	HTML5
	HTML5 localstorage

In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry. I depend on these to keep me ahead of the curve when it comes to technology that is important to me.
I also use Google Alerts to track the most important key phrase in my world....."Kin Lane". Yes I am vain.
