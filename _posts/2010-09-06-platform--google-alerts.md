<img class="alignnone c1" title="Google Alerts" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-alerts.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I spend time each week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business. One of the goals of this [platform definition][1] is to assist in my migration to the cloud.

I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked. I use [Google Alerts][2] to discover new information on blogs, search, and other discussions.

I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:

  * Amazon Web Services
  * Amazon EC2
  * Amazon S3
  * Application Programming Interface
  * API
  * Cloud Computing
  * HTML5
  * HTML5 localstorage
In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry. I depend on these to keep me ahead of the curve when it comes to technology that is important to me.

I also use [Google Alerts][2] to track the most important key phrase in my world....."**Kin Lane**". Yes I am vain.
