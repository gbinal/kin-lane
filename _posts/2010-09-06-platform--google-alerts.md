{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spend time each week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business.One of the goals of this platform definition is to assist in my migration to the cloud.I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked.I use Google Alerts to discover new information on blogs, search, and other discussions.I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:

	Amazon Web Services
	Amazon EC2
	Amazon S3
	Application Programming Interface
	API
	Cloud Computing
	HTML5
	HTML5 localstorage

In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry.</p>
