     <img class="alignnone c1" title="Google Alerts" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-alerts.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I spend time each week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business. One of the goals of this <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/platform/">platform definition</a> is to assist in my migration to the cloud. I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to discover new information on blogs, search, and other discussions. I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Amazon Web Services
     </li>
     <li>Amazon EC2
     </li>
     <li>Amazon S3
     </li>
     <li>Application Programming Interface
     </li>
     <li>API
     </li>
     <li>Cloud Computing
     </li>
     <li>HTML5
     </li>
     <li>HTML5 localstorage
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry. I depend on these to keep me ahead of the curve when it comes to technology that is important to me. I also use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to track the most important key phrase in my world....."<strong>Kin Lane</strong>". Yes I am vain.
