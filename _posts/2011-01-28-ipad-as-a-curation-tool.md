<a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/information-curation-with-my-google-reader/" target="_blank">Google Reader is the primary application I use for information curation</a>. I currently have 572 subscriptions that I stay on top of daily. <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apple/apple_ipad_2.jpg"  width="250" align="right" /></a> I just cleaned this list of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/rss/">RSS</a> subscriptions up to keep moremanageableand realistic.
If I don't stop what I"m doing every 3-4 hours and read, my posts get out of hand. I try to avoid the dreaded +(1000).
I don't see this as information overload, I see it as not properly applying filters and tools.
One tool proving to be critical in my daily digestion and curation of my RSS feeds in Google Reader is my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a>.
I can digest and curate hundreds of posts much quicker than on my laptop. Not sure why, it just works.
I'm trying to stop every 2 hours and digest my feeds on IPad, it is a nice break from my laptop / workstation. I find I read more, tag more and share more via my IPad.
