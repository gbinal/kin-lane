{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im always on the lookout for tools that CityGrid publishers can use alongside the web and mobile apps theyve built using CityGrid Places and Advertising APIs.Today I came across a cool Wordpress plugin&nbsp;over at&nbsp;WP Mayor, a site for&nbsp;WordPress news, articles, hacks and plugin reviews, that&nbsp;turns your local blog into an iPhone enabled city guide,&nbsp;called Placeling.To get started,&nbsp;Placeling&nbsp;provides an iPhone app that allows you to mark places that youve been, which will provide the reference for blog posts that you write later.&nbsp;Next you install and activate the&nbsp;Placeling plugin&nbsp;in your Worpress site.Youll notice that now, when you write a blog post youll see a marketer next to the upload photo button, and a new box called Placeling below the main editor.</p>
