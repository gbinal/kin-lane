{% include JB/setup %}<p>It is time to curate my Google Reader subscriptions again.I try to keep my daily blog reading as efficient as possible.To do this I change up my Google Reader in three different ways:

	Google Reader Social Network - I follow people on Google Reader based upon their profile and how much they will contribute to my daily reading.I manually and programmatically evaluate other Google Reader users to see if they will be in my network.Subscription Organization - Every 3-4 months I go through all my Google Reader subscriptions and organize them into folders and unsubscribe from irrelevant feeds.</p>
