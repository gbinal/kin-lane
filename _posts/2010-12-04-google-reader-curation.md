I try to keep my daily blog reading as efficient as possible. To do this I change up my Google Reader in three different ways:

  1. **Google Reader Social Network** \- I follow people on Google Reader based upon their profile and how much they will contribute to my daily reading. I manually and [programmatically evaluate other Google Reader users to see if they will be in my network][1].
  2. **Subscription Organization** \- Every 3-4 months I go through all my Google Reader subscriptions and organize them into folders and unsubscribe from irrelevant feeds.
  3. **New Feed Discovery** \- I search for new "source" RSS feeds from blogs of companies in particular research areas.
I needed to do a lot of house cleaning this round and remove subscriptions for Cloud Computing blogs. There has become a lot of spam in this space and a lot of sources have just gone silent. Not much new to say on the subject I guess.

I am searching for API RSS subscriptions, so I went to the [ProgrammableWeb API directory][2] and added blogs from API service providers I feel are relevant. I have 65 API source blogs I'm following currently. Here is the [API Feed OPML file][3]. I will continue to add new subscriptions (and update OPML file), and curate specific posts from my feeds and share in my [API Industry RSS feed][4].
