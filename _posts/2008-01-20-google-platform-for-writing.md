    I use the Google Platform to help me build and evolve my central content platform.For either one project or across all of them.I too am a software developer so I approach very similar.I have been
    using Google Platform to organize and publish my thoughts for some time now.I have wanted to start blogging on how I do this and work to organize my thoughts in a way I can share with others.
