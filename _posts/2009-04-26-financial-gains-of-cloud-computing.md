    I read probably 10-20 articles daily about the cost savings of cloud computing.So many of them.This is definitely an area of consideration when making the migration to the cloud for your
    business.However I would like to see more analysts talk about the efficiency gains regarding performance and generally meeting the demands of your customers.There are a lot of savings and
    improvements in this area.
