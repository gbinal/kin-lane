    Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work.It just doesnt happen overnight.It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work.APIs are a big
    part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like Elance are building the workforce to support the APIs.You can leverage the Elance platform to: Providing High
    Quality, Professional Developers Develop API SDK and Code Samples Develop API skills test and accreditation I have developed this prototype API developer area, driven by the Elance community to
    show what is possible using the Elance API.
