{% include JB/setup %}<p>Need to share my thoughts on an amazing book that has really changed and accelerated the way I think about the web.    After I read this book I literally was high from what it exposed me to, after I was done it has taken me weeks to absorb what was told.I recommend everyone to read this book and let it change the way you'll see the future of the Internet.  Here is an excerpt from the books site:Today, encyclopedias, jetliners, operating systems, mutual funds, and many other items are being created by teams numbering in the thousands or even millions. While some leaders fear the heaving growth of these massive online communities, Wikinomics proves this fear is folly. Smart firms can harness collective capability and genius to spur innovation, growth, and success.                 A brilliant primer on one of the most profound changes of our time, Wikinomics challenges our most deeply-rooted assumptions about business and will prove indispensable to anyone who wants to understand the key forces driving competitiveness in the twenty-first century.                 Based on a $9 million research project led by bestselling author Don Tapscott, Wikinomics shows how the masses of people can participate in the economy like never before. They are creating TV news stories, sequencing the human genome, remixing their favorite music, designing software, finding a cure for disease, editing school texts, inventing new cosmetics, and even building motorcycles.Check it out now at: http://www.wikinomics.com</p>
