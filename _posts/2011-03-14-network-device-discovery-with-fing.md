<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/overlook-fing.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I was looking for a network device discovery tool.

I want something that will run at the command line on multiple platforms.

I came across[Fing from Overlook][1].

Fing is acommand line tool for [network and service discovery.][2]

It can detect wireless and wired devices.

It saves network device discovery results to a log file or to a CSV format.

Fing runs on Windows Linux and Mac. You can [download Fing][3] from the Overlook site..
