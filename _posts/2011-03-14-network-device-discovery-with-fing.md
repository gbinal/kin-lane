    <img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/overlook-fing.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I was looking for a network device discovery tool. I want
    something that will run at the command line on multiple platforms. I came across<a title="Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">Fing from Overlook</a>. Fing is acommand line tool for
    <a title="Network and Service Discovery" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">network and service discovery.</a> It can detect wireless and wired devices. It saves network device discovery
    results to a log file or to a CSV format. Fing runs on Windows Linux and Mac. You can <a title="Download Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/index.php/download">download Fing</a> from the
    Overlook site..
