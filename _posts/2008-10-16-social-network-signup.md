So I just signed up for a family social network my mom sent to me. I clicked on link which provided me a simple email / password signup.

I signed up and immediately it had thumbnail for me from my Ning profile.

Is this good?

Does it enforce the fact I should keep my Ning profile up to date and relevant to all relationships?
