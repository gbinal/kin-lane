    So I just signed up for a family social network my mom sent to me.I clicked on link which provided me a simple email / password signup.I signed up and immediately it had thumbnail for me from my
    Ning profile.Is this good?Does it enforce the fact I should keep my Ning profile up to date and relevant to all relationships?
