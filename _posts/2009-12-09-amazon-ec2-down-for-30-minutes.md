{% include JB/setup %}<p>We were trying to finish up a major email blast tonight and all of a sudden our main blast server stopped working.Then I immediately got a flood of email alerts saying all of our live servers were down.I submitted a trouble ticket to Amazon EC2.I have Gold Support package lately with all the email issues we have been having.I looked at their AWS Status Page and it reported nothing.</p>
