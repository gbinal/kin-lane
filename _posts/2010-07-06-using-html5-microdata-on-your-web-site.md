    When it comes to HTML5, for some reason the less visual and more functional aspects of HTML5 is what excites me.I was just reading more about the HTML5 Microdata specification.Microdata is part
    of the HTML5 specs that is relevant to sharing data.MicroData helps web page data to be processed, organized, structured or presented in context.Microdata, is a way of embedding information in
    your web page that makes your existing data machine readable.
