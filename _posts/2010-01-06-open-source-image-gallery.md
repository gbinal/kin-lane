I am trying to find to find an appropriate solution for a friend that will allow him to manage a photo collection. Rather than build something from scratch I thought I'd take a look to see whats out there.

I came across [Plogger][1], a great [open-source web photo gallery][1].

It is an excellent example of quality FREE / Open Source software that has a single purpose and lives up to it.

I just quickly downloaded and [installed it at a subdomain][2]. I was able to login and manage it quickly, simlilar to Wordpress.

I would like to play with some cloud enhancements to it:

  * Allow easy install on an Amazon EC2 instance as a SaaS tool.
  * Image storage on Amazon S3
  * Flickr Integration
  * Picasa Integration
  * Flash Image Upload
Just some thoughts as I am playing with it. More to come as I learn more about it.
