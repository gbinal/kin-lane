{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am trying to find to find an appropriate solution for a friend that will allow him to manage a photo collection. Rather than build something from scratch I thought I'd take a look to see whats out there.
I came across Plogger, a great open-source web photo gallery.
It is an excellent example of quality FREE / Open Source software that has a single purpose and lives up to it.
I just quickly downloaded and installed it at a subdomain. I was able to login and manage it quickly, simlilar to Wordpress.
I would like to play with some cloud enhancements to it:

	Allow easy install on an Amazon EC2 instance as a SaaS tool.
	Image storage on Amazon S3
	Flickr Integration
	Picasa Integration
	Flash Image Upload

Just some thoughts as I am playing with it. More to come as I learn more about it.
