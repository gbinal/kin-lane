    I am trying to find to find an appropriate solution for a friend that will allow him to manage a photo collection. Rather than build something from scratch I thought I'd take a look to see whats
    out there. I came across <a href="http://www.plogger.org/">Plogger</a>, a great <a href="http://www.plogger.org/">open-source web photo gallery</a>. It is an excellent example of quality FREE /
    Open Source software that has a single purpose and lives up to it. I just quickly downloaded and <a href="http://imagegallery.kinlane.com">installed it at a subdomain</a>. I was able to login and
    manage it quickly, simlilar to Wordpress. I would like to play with some cloud enhancements to it:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Allow easy install on an Amazon EC2 instance as a SaaS tool.
      </li>
      <li>Image storage on Amazon S3
      </li>
      <li>Flickr Integration
      </li>
      <li>Picasa Integration
      </li>
      <li>Flash Image Upload
      </li>
    </ul>Just some thoughts as I am playing with it. More to come as I learn more about it.
