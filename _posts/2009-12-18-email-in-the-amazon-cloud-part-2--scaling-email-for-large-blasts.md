    I needed to send a large amounts of email.We are talking 500,000 to 1 million emails in each send.These are emails being sent to encourage event attendance or interaction, so they need to go out
    quickly.The powers that be wanted to have emails go out in 24 hours.In the past we would send emails and then sit and watch servers for 24-72 hours, with constant server restarts and other
    problems.
