Do you have copies of business documents, books or other papers and photos laying around that you'd love to have digitized? Maybe you want to get rid of the originals, but still have a copy, or maybe you just want to recreate online so you can share with others.

There is a new company called[1dollarscan.com][1], that will scan and digitize books, business documents, greeting cards, and photos.

The owner of 1dollarscan.com had over 2,000 books and they were crowding out his Tokyo apartment, so he decided to scan them all, so he could have them all on his iPad. Six months later they had the largest digital scanning service in Japan with over 200 employees doing the same thing for customers in Japan.
