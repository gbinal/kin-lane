    Google added another interesting piece to its API stack.Now with the Google AJAX Language API, you can translate and detect the language of blocks of text within a webpage using only
    Javascript.The language API is designed to be used to translate and detect languages on the fly when off line translations are not available.It is a nice addition to the Google Family of APIs and
    great for internationalization of web applications.
