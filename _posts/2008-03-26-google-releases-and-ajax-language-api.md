{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google added another interesting piece to its API stack.  Now with the Google AJAX Language API, you can translate and detect the language of blocks of text within a webpage using only Javascript.       The language API is designed to be used to translate and detect languages on the fly when off line translations are not available.It is a nice addition to the Google Family of API's and great for internationalization of web applications.</p>
