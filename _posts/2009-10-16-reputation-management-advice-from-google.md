    I provide reputation management advice to many of my friends and colleagues and have lots of theories on how to best achieve desired results. Today I came across the same advice directly from
    Google. It is good to see <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/managing-your-reputation-through-search.html">Google providing their own reputation management advice</a>.
