    Email is still the number one tool for managing events and communicating with attendees, speakers, and exhibitors.Social network is definitely the future of the event communication, but until
    then email rules.Sending out call for papers, speaker, exhibitor, attendee invitations and other emails around a conference can require a well oiled email infrastructure to make sure emails get
    into the inbox.I see events send anywhere from a few hundred to several million emails over the life span of an event.Sending emails in the cloud can work well whether your sending a small amount
    using Google Apps or millions using Amazon Web Services.
