    Understanding how the federal government spends our money is on all of our minds, especially this time of year.I recently pulled out an old tool I build last year to visual the State of Oregon
    spending, and reworked it to help visualize Obamas 2012 Federal Budget.I wanted to set what my priorities were regarding the federal budget.Im not 100% finished, still have a little work to do on
    it.Today I came across a very cool data visualization contest called the Data Viz Challenge.
