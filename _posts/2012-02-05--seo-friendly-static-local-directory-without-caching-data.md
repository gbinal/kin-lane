{% include JB/setup %}<p>I&rsquo;m working on several prototypes for building CityGrid local directories, demonstrating best practices when building web and mobile apps using CityGrid APIs.One question I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot lately is how are developers supposed to build SEO friendly local directories with static pages if they aren&rsquo;t allowed to cache businesses and places from the CityGrid API?It is true, per the&nbsp;CityGrid Usage Requirements,&nbsp;you aren&rsquo;t allowed to store places data in a local database or cache locally.But if you think about this, it isn&rsquo;t a negative, its a positive.You don&rsquo;t have to manage the potentially millions of business listings (which isn&rsquo;t easy), and when a business updates their profile you don&rsquo;t have to worry about having out of date information.</p>
