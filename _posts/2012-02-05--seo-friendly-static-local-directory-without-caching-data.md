    I’m working on several prototypes for building CityGrid local directories, demonstrating best practices when building web and mobile apps using CityGrid APIs.One question I’ve gotten a lot lately
    is how are developers supposed to build SEO friendly local directories with static pages if they aren’t allowed to cache businesses and places from the CityGrid API?It is true, per
    the&nbsp;CityGrid Usage Requirements,&nbsp;you aren’t allowed to store places data in a local database or cache locally.But if you think about this, it isn’t a negative, its a positive.You don’t
    have to manage the potentially millions of business listings (which isn’t easy), and when a business updates their profile you don’t have to worry about having out of date information.
