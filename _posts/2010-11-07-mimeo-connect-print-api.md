    Ive talked about the My Mimeo online print and publishing, and the My Mimeo Marketplace where you can publish documents for people to purchase.Now I feel I can actually introduce you to the Mimeo
    Connect Print API, now that you have an overview of Mimeo.Mimeo offers a SOAP Print API as its core enterprise print offering, however my focus with Mimeo is the REST Print API.The REST API uses
    basic HTTP Authentication for access your My Mimeo Account, and provides the following services: Account Service - Management of your My Mimeo Account(s).Document Service - Access and management
    of your Mimeo documents assembled in your My Mimeo account.
