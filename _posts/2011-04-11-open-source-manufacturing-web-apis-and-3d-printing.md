    I just finished reading, Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing, on Mashable.I also had a link to an open source manufacturing site bookmarked from a couple months ago.And of course I live and
    breathe Web APIs on a daily basis.So after reading all this, my mind starts thinking about open source manufacturing processes bundled with open web APIs, and the future of 3-D printing and / or
    manufacturing.Open Source Manufacturing - Open source manufacturing lets you download hardware, blue-prints, and instructions for any potential manufacturing process.
