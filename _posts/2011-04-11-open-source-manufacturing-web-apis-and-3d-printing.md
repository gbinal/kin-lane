I just finished reading, [Will 3-D Printing End Mass Manufacturing][2], on Mashable.

I also had a link to an [open source manufacturing][3] site bookmarked from a couple months ago.

And of course I live and breathe [Web APIs][4] on a daily basis.

So after reading all this, my mind starts thinking about open source manufacturing processes bundled with open web APIs, and the future of 3-D printing and / or manufacturing.

  * **[Open Source Manufacturing][5]** \- Open source manufacturing lets you download hardware, blue-prints, and instructions for any potential manufacturing process.
  * **[Web-APIs][6]** \- An interface that allows application developers to build on top of data or another application.
  * **[3-D Printing][7]** -3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology where a three dimensional object is created by laying down successive layers of material.
When you start thinking of this in terms of local, cottage style manufacturing, I can see lots ofpossibilities.

Imagine, a group of people in a small town, research a need for a component or product. Buy a 3-D Printer, register it with a open API manufacturing network (say based on [Google Cloud Print][8]). Now they can take orders in real-time over the Internet.

An open source manufacturing network that uses web APIs to receive jobs in real-time and builds products using 3-D printers.
