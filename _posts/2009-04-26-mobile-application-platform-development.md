    IPhone applications are a success, no arguement here.With this success there are a lot of of mobile providers mimicking this.We saw the recent release of the Blackberry application directory and
    we see other mobile carriers talking of the same.Having a platform development kit for your mobile platform will be a requirement to do business in the next couple years.US schools are definitely
    falling behind in providing quality programmers to meet the need of desktop and web site and application development.
