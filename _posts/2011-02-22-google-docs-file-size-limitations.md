{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spent some time this evening researching file size limitations for Google Docs.Here is what I found:

	Documents - 512,000 characters, regardless of the number of pages or font size.Uploaded document files that are converted to Google documents format cant be larger than 1MB.Spreadsheets - Uploaded spreadsheet files that are converted to Google spreadsheets format cant be larger than 20MB, and need to be under 400,000 cells and 256 columns per sheet.Presentations: - Presentations created in Google Docs can be up to 10MB -- which is about 200 slides.</p>
