{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spent some time this evening researching file size limitations for Google Docs.  Here is what I found:

	Documents - 512,000 characters, regardless of the number of pages or font size. Uploaded document files that are converted to Google documents format can't be larger than 1MB.
	Spreadsheets - Uploaded spreadsheet files that are converted to Google spreadsheets format can't be larger than 20MB, and need to be under 400,000 cells and 256 columns per sheet.
	Presentations: - Presentations created in Google Docs can be up to 10MB -- which is about 200 slides.
	Drawings - There is no document size limitation posted.

One thing I did not know was that files you upload, but do not convert to Google Doc format can be up to 1GB in size.
I have been concerned with using Google Docs as primary cloud storage because I always seem to be getting yelled at for file size too large on upload. However I'm always converting file at upload.
1GB is plenty big for any file I will be storing in the clouds. If I need bigger I can use Amazon S3.
