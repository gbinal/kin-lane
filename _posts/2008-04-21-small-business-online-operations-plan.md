{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been working with my brother-in-law to really escalate the operations of his small business Thinwrench, which offers custom wrench and tool manufacturing.He has had the business since the 1990s and has had the site since I believe 2001.The site gets a fair amount of traffic and it generates a small trickle of orders for him though out the year, but nothing really significant.It is impressive though considering he does next to nothing to maintain or evolve the site, its content, and online presence.So we are always trying to get together and breathe some life into it.</p>
