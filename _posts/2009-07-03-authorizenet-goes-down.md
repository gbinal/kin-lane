Was just reading a blog post on Techcrunch about [Authorize.net going down due to a fire in Seattle][1]. Crazy stuff.

Seems like they really had everything tight regarding their systems and even the data center they were in. The fire caused the sprinklers to fry the backup generator.

Authorize.net is a mission critical 3rd party provider and definitely impacted a lot of businesses financially.

Seems like a company with that size and scale would have some sort of DNS2 located at a data center somewhere else in the country? Or have multiple data centers geographically located at key hubs in the United States.

Feel bad for all the e-commerce sites that are dependent on Authorize.net for their sales.
