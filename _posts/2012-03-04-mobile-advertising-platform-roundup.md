{% include JB/setup %}<p>I&rsquo;m doing more research for my&nbsp;Local, Mobile, Social Stack, and spending some time understanding the mobile advertising space.So far I&rsquo;ve found 24 mobile advertising platforms:

Adfonic&nbsp;- Global mobile advertising marketplace
AdMob&nbsp;- Tools to promote, measure and monetize mobile apps
Admoda&nbsp;- Global mobile advertising marketplace
BuzzCity&nbsp;- Global mobile advertising network
Chitika&nbsp;- Online Web and Mobile Advertising Network
CityGrid Custom Ads API&nbsp;- The raw, parts and pieces of local advertisements
CityGrid Mobile Ads API&nbsp;- Local mobile advertising network
Google Mobile Ads&nbsp;- Mobile advertising network
GreyStripe&nbsp;- Brand-focused mobile advertising network
Hunt Mobile Ads&nbsp;- Mobile advertising platform
InMobi&nbsp;- Mobile advertising platform
Inneractive&nbsp;- Mobile app monetization exchange
Jumptap&nbsp;- Targeted mobile advertising
Madvertise&nbsp;- Global mobile advertising network
Microsoft Mobile Advertising&nbsp;- MSN Advertising Network
Millennial Media&nbsp;- mobile advertising &amp; data platform

Mobile Theory&nbsp;- Mobile advertising network
NAVTEQ Media Solutions&nbsp;- Location based, mobile advertising network
Rvolve Hyperlocal Ads&nbsp;- Hyperlocal advertising platform

This is is just a round-up, next I will profile what each of the mobile advertising providers offer and see how the&nbsp;CityGrid advertising network&nbsp;compares.Many of these networks offer mobile advertising for the entire world, beyond the local advertising space, but I want to see as many of the providers as I can.Stayed tuned for more detail on mobile advertising as part of the&nbsp;CityGrid local, mobile, social stack.</p>
