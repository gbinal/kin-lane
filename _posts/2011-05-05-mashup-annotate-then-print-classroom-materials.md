{% include JB/setup %}<p>APIs are transforming the way we print.Im always looking for other APIs that compliment the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.I recently addedCrocodoc to our application directory.Crocodoc takes PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations, and allows users to view and mark them up online.Crocodoc also provides anannotation API,  allowing application developers to integrate PDF, Word, and Powerpoint annotation into their applications.</p>
