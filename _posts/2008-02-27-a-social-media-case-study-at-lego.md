Was just watching a great video on [Jeremiah Owyang's blog][1] about a [Social Media Case Study][2] from Jake McKee who used to work at Lego.

It was very interesting to see how entrenched and distance from customers a company can be. Also how resistant to change a company can be when it comes to opening up to new ideas, change and ultimately their customers.

Of course Lego is a very large company and has a unique product line, but it really shows an interested way of embracing the smaller more passionate segment of your audience and leveraging them to reach the larger portion of our customer base.

Give it a watch, it is called: [The Tenacity of Jake McKee: A Social Media Case Study at Lego.][3]
