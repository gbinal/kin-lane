{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been reading up on data center operations lately and what goes into building a data center that a cloud / virtualization methodology could be deployed to provide various public or private cloud computing.I come across many great studies on building Green Data Centers, I was reading this one today: Cloud Computing: Truly Green Data Centers
It was a good article talking about Green data center operations from a small business perspective.I was also watching this video the other day on a Google Data Center.I see a lot of growth coming up in the next few years in Cloud Computing and therefore in data center construction.Obviously green will play a big part in this.</p>
