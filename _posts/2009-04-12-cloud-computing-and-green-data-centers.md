    I have been reading up on data center operations lately and what goes into building a data center that a cloud / virtualization methodology could be deployed to provide various public or private
    cloud computing.I come across many great studies on building Green Data Centers, I was reading this one today: Cloud Computing: Truly Green Data Centers It was a good article talking about Green
    data center operations from a small business perspective.I was also watching this video the other day on a Google Data Center.I see a lot of growth coming up in the next few years in Cloud
    Computing and therefore in data center construction.Obviously green will play a big part in this.
