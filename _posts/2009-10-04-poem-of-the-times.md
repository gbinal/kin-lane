{% include JB/setup %}<p>Since 2006 I have been gathering a top headline from the top 20 newspapers in the country.I pull these headlines using RSS feeds programatically every morning at 8:30 AM pacific time.I then assemble these into a sort of poem for that day.I was redoing my site a year or so ago and got to busy and never put back up.Kaia was bugging me to get her web site up tonight, and it only took me another 20 minutes to get Poem of the Times back up.</p>
