    Amazon Web Services has added a new and more flexible way to manage an account.They have added the ability for: Consolidated billing across multiple AWS accounts Volume pricing across more than
    one AWS account Way to track the cost of a project across an organization.The new billing feature lets you designate one AWS account as a paying account and a set of other accounts as linked
    accounts to form a simple one-level hierarchy.The AWS usage within the linked accounts is rolled up into the paying account for volume pricing and billing purposes, so theres just one AWS bill
    per month.The account relationship is solely for accounting purposes and normal AWS permissions still apply.
