<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/printing-press.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I'm doing my monthly review of the printing API playing field, and wanted to share every API I could find that delivers print-on-demand and self-publishing services for developers.

**[The Enthusem API][1]**\- The Enthusem API allows you to use the backend functions of Enthusem from your own user interface. For example, if you have yor own CRM system and would like your users to send cards from it, you can use our API so your CRM system can talk back and forth with Enthusem. If you wanted to create a branded card store for your users, you could create your own user interface with your own branding, then tie into Enthusem's backend to handle the fulfillment. In order to correctly use our API, your developer must know how to create an HTTP form POST and how to parse an XML response.

**[Google Cloud Print][2]**\- Google Cloud Print (GCP) enables any app (web, mobile, desktop) on any device to print to any cloud-connected printer. This page provides an overview of GCP and links to all public developer documentation. If you are a physical or virtual printer maker and want to learn how to receive print jobs from Google Cloud Print or manage GCP printers, see the Receiving Print Jobs section. If you are an application developer looking to submit print jobs to Google Cloud Print, see the Submitting Print Jobs section. Finally, if you are a system administrator looking to set up GCP with your printer(s), please see this support site.

**[Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API][3]**\- Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API is a RESTful for interface for printing custom and pre-built documents using your Mimeo.com account. It provides access over your account, proofs, documents, print files, marketplaces, and to get print quotes and place orders via the web API, with response in XML. This API is generally for existing Mimeo.com customers who wish to print existing and print dynamici documents using Mimeo.

**[Mimeo Card Printing API][4]**\- The Mimeo Card Printing API provides card printing services for developers. It enables you to price and order commercially printed cards in different sizes, paper and coating from within your web and mobile applications.
