    Im doing my monthly review of the printing API playing field, and wanted to share every API I could find that delivers print-on-demand and self-publishing services for developers.The Enthusem
    API- The Enthusem API allows you to use the backend functions of Enthusem from your own user interface.For example, if you have yor own CRM system and would like your users to send cards from it,
    you can use our API so your CRM system can talk back and forth with Enthusem.If you wanted to create a branded card store for your users, you could create your own user interface with your own
    branding, then tie into Enthusems backend to handle the fulfillment.In order to correctly use our API, your developer must know how to create an HTTP form POST and how to parse an XML response.
