I was reading Get Live Firefox Chat Support from Mozilla over at LifeHacker and it reminded me of one of my application ideas from my notebook.They are offering live Firefox chat support now using an all volunteer support staff.  They are just passionate Firefox users willing to lend a hand.I had made this recommendation for a client back a few months ago to offer this in the venture capital and business planning industries.  Live chat support for any product or product line seems like a good solution that could be offered in many industries in a sort of open source kind of way. Would take the right company to be open enough to partner with their "prosumers" or other heavy players that way.  But definitely a cheap way to run a real clean, honest support program.
