I came across a blog post in the Huffington Post called, "[Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For 'Tough Times][1]'". So I went and checked out the [California Proposed Budget for 2010 and 2011][2].

I am seeing a lot of PDF documents available regarding the budget, but no data feeds or spreadsheets.

I went ahead and plugged the [California Budget][3] into the [budget priority][3] tool I have been building.

You view the [California Budget Prioritization Tool][3] i built and register for your own account.

The hardest part about plugging these budgets into the prioritization tool is getting the budget data normalized. Everything else is smooth.
