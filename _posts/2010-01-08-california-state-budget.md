    I came across a blog post in the Huffington Post called, Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For Tough Times.So I went and checked out the California Proposed Budget for 2010 and 2011.I am seeing a
    lot of PDF documents available regarding the budget, but no data feeds or spreadsheets.I went ahead and plugged the California Budget into the budget priority tool I have been building.You view
    the California Budget Prioritization Tool i built and register for your own account.
