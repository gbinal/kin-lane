    Rapportive, a social CRM service has added support for Bitbucket, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.Rapportive adds a social CRM layer to Gmail using Google Chrome or Firefox Add-Ons.When viewing an
    email received from a contact in Gmail, Rapportive automatically shows social profiles from Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and others for the user in the sidebar.Rapportive now shows profile
    information for users, extracted from their profiles atBitbucket, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.Social CRM is definitely growing, but also usage of developer social networks as a real-time resume
    for developers is a new growth area as well.
