Lately I am very interested in the Government usage of social media and cloud computing ([SaaS][1], [IaaS][2], and [PaaS][3]) . I have been reading and doing a lot of research in this area lately.

I came across great post on [programmableweb][4] today called [An Online Dialogue to Shapre Recovery.gov][5].

Lots of great information, and showcases how the administration is trying open up government data and make things more transparent.

There is also lots of information on the stimulus money available to fund the next round of growth of the Internet and Cloud Computing
