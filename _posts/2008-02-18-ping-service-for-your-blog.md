Part of your syndication strategy for your blog should be alerting blog search engines that you have made an update.I found a service today called Ping-O-Matic that you can put in your blog name, home page, and rss URL and choose which services to ping that your blog has been updated.This is a great tool to get the word out there regarding your blog.
