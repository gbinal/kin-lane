    Part of your syndication strategy for your blog should be alerting blog search engines that you have made an update.<br />
    <br />
    I found a service today called <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">Ping-O-Matic</a> that you can put in your blog name, home page, and rss URL and choose which services to ping that your blog has
    been updated.<br />
    <br />
    This is a great tool to get the word out there regarding your blog.
