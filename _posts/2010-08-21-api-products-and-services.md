[<img class="alignnone c1" title="Apigee" src="http://apigee.com/images/marketing/logo_large.png" alt="" width="225" height="76" align="right" />][1]I'm seeing a lot of chatter on the Internets lately about API development and best practices. Like [10 Common Mistakes Made by API Providers][2] at RWW and [APIs: an Important Part of Product Strategy][3] at ProgrammableWeb.

I had the pleasure of sitting with the engineer from [Mashery][4] a couple weeks ago and listen to their assessment of the API market. Ever since then I've been reviewing their approach to [API deployment][5] and working to understand the playing field better.

Today I came across [Sonoa][6] and the [free API][1] tools at [Apigee][1]. [Apigee][1] offers:

  * API Testing
  * API Debugging
  * API Analytics
  * API Protection
I'm checking out [Sonoa][6] and what they offer more. I am also adding testing, debugging, and protection to my list of API building blocks.
