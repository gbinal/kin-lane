    Im seeing a lot of chatter on the Internets lately about API development and best practices.Like 10 Common Mistakes Made by API Providers at RWW and APIs: an Important Part of Product Strategy at
    ProgrammableWeb.I had the pleasure of sitting with the engineer from Mashery a couple weeks ago and listen to their assessment of the API market.Ever since then Ive been reviewing their approach
    to API deployment and working to understand the playing field better.Today I came across Sonoa and the free API tools at Apigee.
