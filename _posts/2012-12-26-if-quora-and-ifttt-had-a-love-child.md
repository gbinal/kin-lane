I'm spending a lot of time asking questions about 2012 for various year-end stories.  Some questions I can just go to my database and pull numbers, others I can use various APIs to ask questions of common tools I use like Foursquare, Eventbrite, Twitter and Pinboard.
Many questions like, "How many Twitter followers did I have in June 2012", are either very complex to calculate or impossible if I didn&rsquo;t gather the data at that moment.  I would like to be able to ask specific questions, discover the services that can answer and setup some sort of automation to make sure the question gets asked on a regular basis.

Imagine if Quora and IFTTT had a love child.  A sort of API QA Automation platform.  But it wouldn&rsquo;t be just dependent on APIs, it could run like ScraperWiki and just &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; what it needs to answer questions.
Just a thought.  If someone has the spare time to build something like this, it would sweet!  :)
P.S.  I love reaching the age where I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to build every idea I have as a startup.  Just put them out there and let others take advantage of, and everyone will benefit.</p>
