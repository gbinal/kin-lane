{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im spending a lot of time asking questions about 2012 for various year-end stories.Some questions I can just go to my database and pull numbers, others I can use various APIs to ask questions of common tools I use like Foursquare, Eventbrite, Twitter and Pinboard.Many questions like, How many Twitter followers did I have in June 2012, are either very complex to calculate or impossible if I didn&rsquo;t gather the data at that moment.I would like to be able to ask specific questions, discover the services that can answer and setup some sort of automation to make sure the question gets asked on a regular basis.Imagine if Quora and IFTTT had a love child.</p>
