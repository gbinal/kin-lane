    Finished up a very busy week yesterday at the SAP SAPPHIRE 2009 conference in Orlando, FL.Havent had much time on my hands to do any blogging or much of anything beyond just managing registration
    at SAPPHIRE.The show was a success.I feel good about it.It was my first on-site with the company and it is our largest event of the year.
