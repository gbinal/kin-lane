    The <a class="zem_slink" title="White House" rel="geolocation" href=
    "http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.89767,-77.03655&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=38.89767,-77.03655%20%28White%20House%29&amp;t=h">White House</a> recently announced the <a href=
    "http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/Development-2-point-0-Challenge">Development 2.0 Challenge</a>, a <a href=
    "http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/Development-2-point-0-Challenge">Tech Competition for the Developing World</a>. They are attempting to crowd-source international development
    initiatives and get away from programs being designed by experts and government officials without sufficient input from citizens, social entrepreneurs, or people. They are looking forpeople from
    around the world to submit ideas for solving various development issues. They look to reach out to non-traditional groups including students, social entrepreneurs, and individuals with great
    ideas for solving a development problem in every sector, including disaster management, health, agriculture, and education. Definitely exciting to see some more innovation coming from the White
    House. Crowd sourcing is the ultimate usage of technology for democracy. Although it is kind of socialist too. Hmmmm...
