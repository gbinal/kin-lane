    I have seen a lot of press about how the stimulus money is being spend and tracked.I have come across many ideas for how this should be tracked.I have gone through all 50 states recovery web
    sites as well as many of the federal agency web sites.There is definitely no rhyme or reason to how thiis money and projects are being tracked.I see several organizations such as the Sunlight
    Foundation, National Institute on Money in State Politics, OMB Watch, and many others that are pursuing Government transparency, data feeds and general accountability of government with the
    assistance of technology and cloud computing.
