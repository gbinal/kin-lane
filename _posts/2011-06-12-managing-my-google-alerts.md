{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am making some adjustments to my Google Alerts today.I removed a few and added a few alerts.Here are my current Google Alerts:

	call for papers
	kin lane
	open API
	REST API
	self publishing
	self-publishing
	API Evangelist
	apple airprint
	Application Programming Interface
	Google Cloud Print
	hackathon
	HP ePrint
	Print on Demand
	Web Services

I have all of them delivered once a day, via RSS feeds.This way I can monitor in real-time using Google Reader.I adjust these every week if I can, but sometimes it remains pretty constant.</p>
