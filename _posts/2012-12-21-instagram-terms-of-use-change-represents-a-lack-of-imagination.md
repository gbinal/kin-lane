    As a startup, you are bound to reach a point in your evolution where money will blind you, whether its during roadmap planning or communicating with your customers--eventually you will be blinded
    by your investors.Once you’ve taken on enough investment, or the load of the parent company who acquired, you will start seeing things differently.You won’t see your users the same way anymore,
    this will be reflected in how you deliver features, or structure your roadmap--it isn’t about users anymore, it is about profit.Once you enter this phase your imagination goes away, and you work
    to speak in terms that your investors understand.This is where I feel Instagram is at.
