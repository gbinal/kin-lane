<img class="alignnone c1" title="Red Hat Linux" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/red-hat.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Red Hat has been part of the cloud with services like [Amazon EC2][1] since the beginning, because they are a leading open source platform. Not be outdone by other technology providers, [Red Hat is offering their own line of cloud computing tools and services][2]. When you choose Red Hat for your cloud, you get:

  * The most comprehensive solutions for clouds - both private and public.
  * Consistent enterprise-class environments that bridge the physical and virtual world, inside the datacenter and public clouds.
  * Strategic flexibility without lock-in.
  * Better infrastructure, designed specifically for multi-tenant clouds.
  * Industry-leading ecosystem that makes cloud usable, accessible, and safe.
Red Hat cloud computing solutions include:
  * [Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization][3]
  * [Red Hat Enterprise Linux][4]
  * [Red Hat Network Satellite][5]
  * [Red Hat Enterprise MRG Grid][6]
  * [JBoss Enterprise Middleware][7]
And they offer cloud computing services and provdiders:
  * [Red Hat Certified Cloud Providers][2]
  * [Red Hat Cloud Consulting Services][8]
  * [Red Hat Global Learning Services Cloud Training Courses][9]
It is one of the beautiful things about the cloud movement. Existing players can shift their pricing model, add a few cloudy words and you have a cloud computing provider. It really isn't a big shift, just a new way of thinking.
