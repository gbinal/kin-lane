{% include JB/setup %}I used up all my mojo on my last post, and really can't write much on this topic right now, but I have to at least share this posting I found tonight:
Recovery Recommendations From I School Faculty Sent to the US Government
It is the best recommendation I have read regarding how to change the Government and spend some recovery / stimulus money.
I will write more about it later, lots of thoughts swimming around.
