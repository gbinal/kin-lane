     I used up all my mojo on my last post, and really can't write much on this topic right now, but I have to at least share this posting I found tonight: <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/news/20090417recoveryguidelines">Recovery Recommendations From I School Faculty Sent to the US Government</a> It is the best recommendation I have read regarding how to change the Government and spend some recovery / stimulus money. I will write more about it later, lots of thoughts swimming around.
