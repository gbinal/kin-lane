     I pushed an update for the CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin earlier today.   I finished porting over the changes to the CityGrid Wordpress Search Plugin as well. Both my Wordpress plugins had a pretty basic look and feel, I wanted them to look better. So using the HTML and CSS template I borrowed from CityGrid I added it to both of the CityGrid Wordpress Plugins to make them look sharper. So now both the CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin and CityGrid Wordpress Search Plugin have a default UI template, as well as the ability to switch it and make it look like CityGrid.com. Next I’m going to add another template or two, then start extending the functionality of each template, allowing Wordpress site owners to have as much flexibility when deploying business search or directories using CityGrid Places API.
