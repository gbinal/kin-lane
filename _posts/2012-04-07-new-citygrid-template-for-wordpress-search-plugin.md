{% include JB/setup %}<p>I pushed an&nbsp;update for the CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin&nbsp;earlier today.&nbsp; I finished porting over the changes to the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Search Plugin&nbsp;as well.Both my Wordpress plugins had a pretty basic look and feel, I wanted them to look better.So using the&nbsp;HTML and CSS template I borrowed from CityGrid&nbsp;I added it to both of the CityGrid Wordpress Plugins to make them look sharper.So now both the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin&nbsp;and&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Search Plugin&nbsp;have a default UI template, as well as the ability to switch it and make it look like&nbsp;CityGrid.</p>
