I really enjoy web applications that focus on doing one thing, and doing it well.
Pen.io is one of these apps. Pen.io is the fastest way to publish online. period.
Pen.io allows you to add, edit, and delete pages.  Thats it.
You just give your page a title, set a password, and add.  Then you can edit the body of your page and publish.
Pen.io just launched a new API to support the web application.  It allows you to:

	Authenticate
	Create New Page
	Update Page Content
	Check Page Availability
	Get Page in HTML Format
	Get Page in JSON Format
	Get Page in XML Format
	Delete a Page

The Pen.io API is RESTful and authenticates using an application key in the header.
They provide a directory of pages, about, blog, faq, and contact page.
It doesn't get much simpler than that.  It is a very elegant representation of a Software as a Service for a single resource.
