I attended many great sessions while at [Google I/O][1]. I really started to see the where they are going with using [Google Spreadsheets][2] as data stores.

I have used as data stores for quite a while, but they are really pushing for them to store enterprise data, [application][3] data, [web site][4] data, and much more.

Way back in the day when i was doing [non-profit][5] work I went and conducted a needs assement at a large educational non-profit. To build a specification for developming a new administrative system.

Went I first went in I was told there there is a central [database system][6] by the management. After conducting my multi day technoloy needs assessment I found out that the real staff utilized many many [spreadsheets][7] as data stores to get their work done. They rarely used the central system.

I find this to be common across many organizations.

This is why I think [Google Apps][8] has huge potential for the spreadsheets to be majorly adopted as data stores for the masses in non-profits, business, and enterprises.

I'll talk more formerly about this later.
