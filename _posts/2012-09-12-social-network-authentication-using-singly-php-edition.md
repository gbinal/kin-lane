As an active user of a variety of cloud services I’ve become very accustom to authenticating using my social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LInkedin or Github, rather than creating yet another new account.

If I want access to an online service, and it allows me to authenticate using my social networks, I make a quick assumption on which one is best to use, click on link, give the application appropriate oAuth approval, and begin using the service. I can revoke their access at any time when I manage my oAuth permissions in the social network.

I want to make this default for users of my websites, apps and APIs--allowing them authenticate using six social networks:

**[Facebook**][2]

**[Foursquare][3]**

**[Github][4]**

**[Instagram][5]**

**[LinkedIn][7]**

**[Twitter][8]**

**Singly has made this nice and easy!**

**Step 1 - [Sign up for Singly][9]**

**Step 2 - [Create New Singly App][10]**

**Step 3 - Create Social Network Apps.** This part seems like it is a lot of work, but once done...it is sweet. You need to create an app for each one of the six social networks you will be allowing authentication:

Singly has great instructions to walk you through this process. It will only take you about 5-10 minutes. And once you are done, you will have one API key to access all six of these APIs.

I built a [prototype PHP application][11] that demonstrates this process, you can [download on Github][12]. Once downloaded, all you need to do is add your Singly app keys, and Site URL into the config file.

I provide six links with icons triggering the social network authentication via Singly:

Then I provide [six separate authentication callback handlers][13]. I keep them separate, because I intend to do separate handling for each social network within these callbacks in the near future.

All six callback handlers just set a session with your authentication information and redirect you back to home page for display. What’s next is up to you.

I will be adding more to this social network authentication prototype in the near future. A couple of things I would like to do is have a display profile widget and some sort of ranking of users by social network.
