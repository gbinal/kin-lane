{% include JB/setup %}<p>As an active user of a variety of cloud services I&rsquo;ve become very accustom to authenticating using my social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LInkedin or Github,  rather than creating yet another new account.If I want access to an online service, and it allows me to authenticate using my social networks, I make a quick assumption on which one is best to use, click on link, give the application appropriate oAuth approval, and begin using the service.I can revoke their access at any time when I manage my oAuth permissions in the social network.I want to make this default for users of my websites, apps and APIs--allowing them authenticate using six social networks:




Facebook

Foursquare

Github



Instagram

LinkedIn

Twitter



Singly has made this nice and easy!Step 1 - Sign up for Singly



Step 2 - Create New Singly App





Step 3 - Create Social Network Apps.</p>
