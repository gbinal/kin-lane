    Google took another major step forward in positioning Google Apps as a document publishing platform.Google has added the ability to to see visual pages on your screen, also known as
    pagination.Pagination adds visual page breaks when editing Google Documents, which make the document editor much more familiar to users who have worked in Microsoft Word.Pagination also changes
    whats possible with printing in modern browsers.With native printing, you can print directly from your browser and the printed document will always match what you see on your screen.
