I am a big advocate for educating politicians and our leaders on [cloud computing][1] and what it can do to save money and open up our [government][2] for more involvement by the public at large.

I am amazed at how many leaders are already in the know about cloud computing.

I was just reading a post on [California Secretary of State Debra Bowen and Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner are both big cloud computing advocates][3].

Look for more information as I [research their interest and exploration of cloud computing][4].
