I am a big advocate for educating politicians and our leaders on cloud computing and what it can do to save money and open up our government for more involvement by the public at large.
I am amazed at how many leaders are already in the know about cloud computing.
I was just reading a post on California Secretary of State Debra Bowen and Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner are both big cloud computing advocates.
Look for more information as I research their interest and exploration of cloud computing.
