    Im not being to formal about my posts coming together from the Google I/O conference.A lot of work this week so I havent had time to pull together.So I am just going to rant about a few items
    randomly.One of them is the network and Internet connectivity at conference centers and events.First put the Registration, Information, Session Speakers, Exhibitors and all non-attendees on a
    separate network.
