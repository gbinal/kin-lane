I was just playing with [Cinch which is a new voice to RSS service][1]. It allows you to call a number and it records a podcast for you. It is more focused, but similar to the [voice translation service Jott][2] that I have been using.

It gives you an RSS feed of the calls you make which you can easily blend into a [Feedburner][3] tracking RSS feed.

There is no limit to the recording unlike Jott, but of course it doesn't translate your calls.

Another valuable audio and podcasting web 2.0 service.
