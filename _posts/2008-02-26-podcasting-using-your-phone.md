{% include JB/setup %}I was just playing with Cinch which is a new voice to RSS service.  It allows you to call a number and it records a podcast for you.  It is more focused, but similar to the voice translation service Jott that I have been using.It gives you an RSS feed of the calls you make which you can easily blend into a Feedburner tracking RSS feed.There is no limit to the recording unlike Jott, but of course it doesn't translate your calls.Another valuable audio and podcasting web 2.0 service.
