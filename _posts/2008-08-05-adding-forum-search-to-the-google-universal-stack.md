    I was doing some research tonight for a new social media marketing campaign tonight.I perform due diligence on a topic by running through the Google Search Toolbar.web,images, video and
    blogs.Then I jump over to use BoardTracker and BoardReader to search through forums on different topics.I think Google should go ahead and purchase one of these forum search engines and add it to
    their universal search stack.
