    I just realized a funny thing. I use 3 different browsers on a daily basis now. I use Firefox for my personal sites and web applications. I use Chrome for my work sites and web applications. I
    use IE 8 for watching movies, TV and Media. I generally have work and personal in separate browsers so I can logged into both Google accounts at the same time. Then I use IE for media just
    because if it freezes up and crashes it leaves my work and personal browsers alone. Funny realization.
