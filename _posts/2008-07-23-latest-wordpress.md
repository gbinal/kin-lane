    I was just helping Ahren launch the new Social Media Squad Blog, and we are using the new Wordpresss.<br />
    <br />
    I am really impressed with the functionality. I was able to combine several blogs over the past couple years into one. I did it in minutes.<br />
    <br />
    The interface is very well done. I will review more...
