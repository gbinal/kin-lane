    The integration of 3rd party services in our event management platform is a key part of our development strategy.I evaluate new tools I find as well as constantly evaluate existing tools for new
    ways of using them as part of an event.I was checking out slideshare more becuase I see it used all over the place.I noticed they have an event &amp; conferences section to market your event.You
    can also register as a professional speaker in the slideshare speaker directory.
