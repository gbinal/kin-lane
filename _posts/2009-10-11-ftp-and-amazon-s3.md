{% include JB/setup %}I was just playing with a "cross FTP" tool that allows you to setup your FTP and Amazon S3 connections side by side in the same client.
I do a lot of FTP'ing as well as moving data to Amazon S3. Interesting concept....will play with more and see if it can become a regularly used tool in my toolbox.
Check it out at CrossFTP.
