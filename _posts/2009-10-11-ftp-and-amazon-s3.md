     I was just playing with a "cross FTP" tool that allows you to setup your <a href="http://www.crossftp.com/">FTP and Amazon S3</a> connections side by side in the same client. I do a lot of FTP'ing as well as moving data to Amazon S3. Interesting concept....will play with more and see if it can become a regularly used tool in my toolbox. Check it out at <a href="http://www.crossftp.com/">CrossFTP</a>.
