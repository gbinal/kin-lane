I was just playing with a "cross FTP" tool that allows you to setup your [FTP and Amazon S3][1] connections side by side in the same client.

I do a lot of FTP'ing as well as moving data to Amazon S3. Interesting concept....will play with more and see if it can become a regularly used tool in my toolbox.

Check it out at [CrossFTP][1].
