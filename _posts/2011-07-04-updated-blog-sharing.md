I updated the sharing tools on blog.apievangelist.com today.  Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.
I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:

	Google +1
	Twitter
	LinkedIn

These are the top places that people share posts on API Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.
I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:

	Facebook
	StumbleUpon
	Digg
	Reddit

At first I used AddThis for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted.   So I used individual buttons from the Google +1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:

	Instapaper
	Hacker News
	DZone
	Posterous
	Tumblr
	Reddit

I will be making some major updates to kinlane.com and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site.  I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.
