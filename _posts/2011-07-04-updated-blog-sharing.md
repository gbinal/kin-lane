<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/core-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I updated the sharing tools on blog.apievangelist.com today. Previously it had eight buttons, representing the top social network channels that drive traffic to the blog.

I'm changing it, putting emphasis on:

  * [Google 1][1]
  * [Twitter][2]
  * [LinkedIn][3]
These are the top places that people share posts on API Evangelist that drives traffic to the blog.

<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/secondary-share-buttons.png" alt="" align="right" />I started by adding individual buttons from all the major providers:

  * [Facebook][4]
  * [StumbleUpon][5]
  * [Digg][6]
  * [Reddit][7]
At first I used [AddThis][8] for the whole share toolbar, but I couldn't get it to layout the way I wanted. So I used individual buttons from the Google 1, Twitter and LinkedIn, then I used AddThis for the other top providers:

  * Instapaper
  * Hacker News
  * DZone
  * Posterous
  * Tumblr
  * Reddit
I will be making some major updates to [kinlane.com][9] and using the same share strategy for the blog and web site. I'll keep adjusting to keep in line with top channels that drive traffic to my blogs.
