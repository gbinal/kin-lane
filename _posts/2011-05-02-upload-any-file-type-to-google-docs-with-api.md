    Over the next few days google will be rolling out the ability to upload any file type to Google Documents List API for all accounts.Previously only Google Apps for Business users could upload any
    file type.This opens up Google Docs as a true cloud storage solution.You can store any file type through web interface or via the API.This means any application can use Google Docs as the primary
    file store.
