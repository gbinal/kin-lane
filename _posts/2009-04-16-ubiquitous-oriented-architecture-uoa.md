    A few weeks back I posted a blog entry on my philosophy of a Ubiquitous Oriented Architecture (UOA).It represents my thoughts on developing software with two things in mind: Connectivity and
    dependence on the cloud Ubiquitous access that is seamless to the user When I wrote that early piece on ubiqitous application development I also scribbled this visual.I just got around to
