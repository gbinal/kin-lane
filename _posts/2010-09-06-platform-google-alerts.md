    <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="Google Alerts" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-alerts.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I spend time each
    week to define the technology platform I use to accomplish business. One of the goals of this <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/platform/">platform definition</a> is to assist in my migration to
    the cloud. I realized another tool I use daily, but have overlooked. I use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to discover new information on blogs, search,
    and other discussions. I follow the these key phrases / topics currently:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Amazon Web Services
      </li>
      <li>Amazon EC2
      </li>
      <li>Amazon S3
      </li>
      <li>Application Programming Interface
      </li>
      <li>API
      </li>
      <li>Cloud Computing
      </li>
      <li>HTML5
      </li>
      <li>HTML5 localstorage
      </li>
    </ul>In addition to Google Reader and Twitter I use these daily Google Alerts to discover new sites, topics, and trends in my industry. I depend on these to keep me ahead of the curve when it
    comes to technology that is important to me. I also use <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to track the most important key phrase in my
    world....."<strong>Kin Lane</strong>". Yes I am vain.
