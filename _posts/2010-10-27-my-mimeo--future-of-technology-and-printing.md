    I am in New York City this week kicking off my new career as the API Evangelist for Mimeo Connect.Mimeo Connect is the API for the Mimeo Print Platform.Before evangelizing about the API I have to
    talk about the Mimeo Platform for a bit.I have spent the week learning everything I can about the self-service, next generation print platform.What intrigued me about this job is the unique blend
    of technology and manufacturing that is involved.
