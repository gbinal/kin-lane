    What is the deal with Gmail today?Both my free gmail and google apps for my domain are total resource hogs.After opening either of them my processor goes to about 51% usage and stays there.as
    soon as I close it goes down to 12-15% with all my other applications.I have these 2 email applications open every day with no problem.
