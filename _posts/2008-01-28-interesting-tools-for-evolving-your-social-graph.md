I was reading, [Delver Comes Out Of Stealth With a New Twist on Social Search][1] on Techcrunch tonight.

Delver is a social graph search engine that allows you to easyily connect with people.

Delver is attempting to solve two key search-related problems:

The first is that current search engines do not take into account the identity of the searcher.
The second is that current search engines do not allow users to search for information created and referenced by their own social graph.

Delver seems to be part of the first wave of social graph tools that will allow you to manage, grow and track your social graph.
