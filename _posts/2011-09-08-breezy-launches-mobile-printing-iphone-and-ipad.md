Breezy has been working hard to get the new version of their iOS platform out the door, and build their partner network. I will be working with Jared at Breezy to offer<a title="Mimeo Print Services" href="http://www.mimeo.com/">Mimeo print services</a>, for overnight printing of common business documents, through the Breezy Platform.</p>
