    I was just reading a post while some files upload on Intacct which is an Accounting Ecosystem that groups together various accounting focused services together under one umbrella. It is
    interesting to see this type of aggregation at the SaaS layer of the cloud. I think this is something you will see more at the Software as a Service (SaasS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) , and
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) levels of the cloud. The more you get quality service providers and developers doing one thing really well, there will be a need for a savvy business operations
    to come in and aggregate these offerings under a particular ecosystem or partner group and sell them together. It makes sense, and I think you will see this trend continue in different industries
    as the Cloud environment evolves. I think this will allow developers to do what they do best, create standards for services and interroperability.
