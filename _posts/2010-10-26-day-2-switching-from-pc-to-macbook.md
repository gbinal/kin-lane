    It is now day two of being on my new Macbook Pro, and I am fine.I havent used an Mac computer since high school.I am 38, so 20 years?I have been a PC user my entire adult life.I have jumped on a
    Mac from time to time to troubleshoot something, view a web site, or show my kids something (I bought them an IMac a few years back).
