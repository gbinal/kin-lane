{% include JB/setup %}<p>I havent spent much time on Flickr until recently.I have had an account for years, but only upload every once in a while.Tonight when I logged on to check out the mobile features I notice they are getting more social.It asked me to complete my profile and upload a profile picture and tell a little more about myself.Didnt fill out much about myself, really get tired of putting information about myself.</p>
