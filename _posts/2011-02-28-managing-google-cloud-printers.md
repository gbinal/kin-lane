    I have been getting a lot of questions from users regarding how to manage their Google Cloud Printers.To help guide users stumbling across my site, there are two types of Google Cloud Print
    Users: End Users - You are installing Google Cloud Print on your Windows machine to print to it on your mobile phone.Developers - Developers building Google Cloud Print Proxies and Cloud Print
    Aware Printers.Im in the developer camp.My register cloud printer or my delete cloud printer blog posts wont help end users much, they are for developers.
