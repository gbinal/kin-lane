    I am always willing to admit when I'm wrong. I was just railing on a site for not providing &lt;author&gt; information in their RSS feed. I'm used to pulling the author name using the
    &lt;author&gt; tag. I come to learn that &lt;author&gt; tag is just meant for the post author's email address. &lt;dc:creator&gt; is truly meant for the name of the author. I didn't know this. I
    had to Google it and I came up with this post explaining <a href="http://www.lowter.com/blogs/2008/2/9/rss-dccreator-author" target="_blank">RSS: &lt;author&gt; vs: &lt;dc:creator&gt;</a>.
