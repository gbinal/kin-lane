{% include JB/setup %}I came across a post about a new web service. It is a cloud backup tool. Something I have talked about needing several times. Handy backup utility for all my favorite cloud based applications.
BackupMy.Net is a handy tool that does this for you.
They provide cloud backup services for:

	Top Email Platforms (Gmail, Hotmail, or Windows Live)
	Top Blog Platforms (Wordpress, Blogger, or Typepad)
	Twitter
	Top Picture Platforms (Flickr, Facebook, SmugMug, Picasa, Photobucket)

This is definitely a great service. Although I have to ask...will I actually pay for it? I blindly depend on these cloud services to maintain my data for me.
Also, who will backup the backup. So if I pay this service to aggregate my data, how do I browse / manage it. And what happens if they go away?
Don't get me wrong I think this is a great service. Being the picky developer I am...I would like to see a single utility like Jungle Disk that I could map to various cloud services and choose to backup either to my local drive / disk, Amazon EC2, or Mosso Cloud. It would give me more control over it.
