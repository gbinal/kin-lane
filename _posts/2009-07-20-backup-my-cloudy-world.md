I came across a post about a new web service. It is a [cloud backup tool][1]. Something I have talked about needing several times. Handy backup utility for all my favorite cloud based applications.

[BackupMy.Net][1] is a handy tool that does this for you.

They provide cloud backup services for:

  * Top Email Platforms ([Gmail][2], [Hotmail][3], or Windows Live)
  * Top Blog Platforms (Wordpress, [Blogger][4], or [Typepad][5])
  * Twitter
  * Top Picture Platforms ([Flickr][6], [Facebook][7], [SmugMug][8], [Picasa][9], [Photobucket][10])
This is definitely a great service. Although I have to ask...will I actually pay for it? I blindly depend on these cloud services to maintain my data for me.

Also, who will backup the backup. So if I pay this service to aggregate my data, how do I browse / manage it. And what happens if they go away?

Don't get me wrong I think this is a great service. Being the picky developer I am...I would like to see a single utility like Jungle Disk that I could map to various cloud services and choose to backup either to my local drive / disk, Amazon EC2, or Mosso Cloud. It would give me more control over it.
