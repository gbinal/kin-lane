Google added [two new features into their Google Docs - Forms tool][1]. You can now:

  1. Add Page Breaks - Breaks in your form allow a wizard style or multi-page form.
  2. Logic Branch - Which allows you to break your form pages up to have different results based upon answers to questions.
Both these features continues to push Google Forms out there as a viable survey, registration and form building tool for organizations to use on their web sites and applications.

You can also email forms to people. With data access through the [Google Docs][2] API it makes it a powerful information gathering and aggregation tool.
