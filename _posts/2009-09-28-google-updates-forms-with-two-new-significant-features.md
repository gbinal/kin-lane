{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google added two new features into their Google Docs - Forms tool. You can now:

	Add Page Breaks - Breaks in your form allow a wizard style or multi-page form.
	Logic Branch - Which allows you to break your form pages up to have different results based upon answers to questions.

Both these features continues to push Google Forms out there as a viable survey, registration and form building tool for organizations to use on their web sites and applications.
You can also email forms to people. With data access through the Google Docs API it makes it a powerful information gathering and aggregation tool.
