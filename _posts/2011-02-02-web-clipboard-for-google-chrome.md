I just installed the [Google Web Clipboard][1] in my Google Chrome browser.<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

It allows me to store text and HTML content and access it across any Google Apps.

I like the concept of having a single cloud based clip-board. I use [Snippely for my code snippets][2], which I would like to see be cloud-based.

Now if Google would just create a simple IDE for the Google Apps suite I would be rock'n!
