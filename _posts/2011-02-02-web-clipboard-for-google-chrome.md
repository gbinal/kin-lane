     I just installed the Google Web Clipboard in my Google Chrome browser. It allows me to store text and HTML content and access it across any Google Apps. I like the concept of having a single cloud based clip-board. I use Snippely for my code snippets, which I would like to see be cloud-based. Now if Google would just create a simple IDE for the Google Apps suite I would be rock'n!
