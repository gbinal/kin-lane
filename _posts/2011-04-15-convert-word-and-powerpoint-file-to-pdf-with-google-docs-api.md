{% include JB/setup %}I'm slowly packaging up all the code I've been writing lately for Google Docs Listing API.
I am building quite a few bite size modules that do various things with Google Docs.
Today I cleaned up a piece of PHP code that will upload file to Google Docs using API, then export various file types.
If it is a .doc file, it will convert to:

	.pdf
	.png
	.swf
	.txt
	.html

If it is a .ppt file, it will convert to:

	.pdf
	.png
	.swf
	.txt

This code is a stripped down version of the Zend - Google Docs API PHP language library, and requires the Zend Gdata Library to run.
