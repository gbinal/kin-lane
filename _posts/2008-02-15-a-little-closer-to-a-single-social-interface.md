    A new startup called PageOnce makes an attempt to create a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface</a>. This doesn't appear to be too
    much different than <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a> or <a href="http://www.pageflakes.com">Pageflakes</a>. However since it is in private BETA I can't really take it for a test
    drive.<br />
    <br />
    Definitely a common problem for social networking and other web application fatigue when you have to go to each site and maintain.<br />
    <br />
    I try to keep up on all my applications and networks, however fall way short when I just get tired of doing it.<br />
    <br />
    We'll see if PageOnce can achieve my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2007/11/social-networks-email-and-more.html">single social interface</a>.
