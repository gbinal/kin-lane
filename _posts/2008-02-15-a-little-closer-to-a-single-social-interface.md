A new startup called PageOnce makes an attempt to create a [single social interface][1]. This doesn't appear to be too much different than [Netvibes][2] or [Pageflakes][3]. However since it is in private BETA I can't really take it for a test drive.

Definitely a common problem for social networking and other web application fatigue when you have to go to each site and maintain.

I try to keep up on all my applications and networks, however fall way short when I just get tired of doing it.

We'll see if PageOnce can achieve my [single social interface][1].
