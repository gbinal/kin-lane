{% include JB/setup %}<p>A new startup called PageOnce makes an attempt to create a single social interface.This doesnt appear to be too much different than Netvibes or Pageflakes.However since it is in private BETA I cant really take it for a test drive.Definitely a common problem for social networking and other web application fatigue when you have to go to each site and maintain.I try to keep up on all my applications and networks, however fall way short when I just get tired of doing it.</p>
