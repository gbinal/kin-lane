Jasondb is a cloud-based, RESTful JSON database designed to replace MySQL as the database in traditional web development

Jasondb persists the data in the same JSON format used by many AJAX driven sites.
Jasondb provides indexing, metadata indexing, tagging and searching with JSON documents.
All of the features and functions of Jasondb are accessible via the RESTful API.
Jasondb appears to scale automatically with the help of Amazon Web Services (AWS).
