    I just did some investigation into some verisoning issues with a system we are developing. Something I do regularly. As I was waiting for the SVN repository to update I was reading some Cloud
    Computing articles. It made me think how I would really like some sort of version control for all my cloud activities. I would like it to remember every instance I launch, setting, data
    manipulation, sync, transfer. Basically anything i do regarding my cloud architecture I would like it to log and remember. As well as have a logging for every person involved in my architecture.
    Wonder how this could be applied to alleviate data and privacy concerns with the cloud and its use in government and corporate applications.
