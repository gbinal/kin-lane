    I just did some investigation into some verisoning issues with a system we are developing.Something I do regularly.As I was waiting for the SVN repository to update I was reading some Cloud
    Computing articles.It made me think how I would really like some sort of version control for all my cloud activities.I would like it to remember every instance I launch, setting, data
    manipulation, sync, transfer.
