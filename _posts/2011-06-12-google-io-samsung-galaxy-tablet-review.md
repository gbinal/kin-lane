{% include JB/setup %}<p>Its been a month since Google I/O.I figured its about time to do a write-up about the Samsung Galaxy Tab that Google was so kind to give me at the event.Ive been using it since, and I will be keeping it as my primary tablet device.I even gave my IPad to my daughter to seal the deal.For me the Samsung Galaxy is more functional as an actual working device, than the IPad ever was.</p>
