    disconnect between cloud computing and Internet connectivity.Bottleneck In Cloud Computing Adoption - Ive read several posts on this, but have not written one my self.Slow connections will
    prevent cloud computing adoption.ATT Broadband and Mobile Internet Service - Discussions around quality of AT&amp;T broadband and mobile Internet service.
