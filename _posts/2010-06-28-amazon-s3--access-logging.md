    I was mapping some subdomains to various Amazon S3 buckets today.I decided to use the new Amazon S3 interface available in the Amazon Console, instead of S3Fox for a change.I was setting the
    permissions for a new bucket and I noticed the logging feature for each bucket.For some reason this has escaped me.I see in the developers area that S3 Logging has been around for years?
