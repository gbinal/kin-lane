Another great post from Dion Hinchliffe @ ZD Net.....[Determining the ROI of Entrpise 2.0][1]

Each of Dion's articles leave me processing the links and information for days. Every IT director should be following his blog.

Excellent advice as you are trying to figure out how to navigate the migration to Enterprise 2.0 and into the clouds.
