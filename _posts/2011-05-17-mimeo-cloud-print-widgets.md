{% include JB/setup %}<p>Widgets and other embeddable objects are the number one request we get at Mimeo Connect.Everyone is busy these days, and they just need a quick way to enable users to build, purchase and print documents from anywhere.So Ive started adding widgets to the Mimeo Cloud Print Platform.Right now I just have HTML widgets, but soon I will be adding JavaScript versions.I have eight widgets in 3 categories currently:
Building and Purchasing Documents

	Link to Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase
	Upload Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase
	Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase

Purchasing Pre-Built Documents

	Link to Custom Document w/ Purchase
	Upload Custom Document w/ Purchase
	Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Purchase

Ordering w/ Existing Document and Billing

	Existing Document Credit Card Purchase
	Existing Document with Mimeo Account Purchase

These are based upon the requests I get most from developers and other people looking to integrate with Mimeo.</p>
