<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/widgets/bound-document-widget.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Widgets and other embeddable objects are the number one request we get at [Mimeo Connect][1].

Everyone is busy these days, and they just need a quick way to enable users to build, purchase and [print documents][2] from anywhere.

So I've started adding widgets to the [Mimeo Cloud Print Platform][3]. Right now I just have HTML widgets, but soon I will be adding JavaScript versions.

I have eight widgets in 3 categories currently:

**Building and Purchasing Documents**

  * [Link to Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase][4]
  * [Upload Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase][5]
  * [Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase][6]
**Purchasing Pre-Built Documents**

  * [Link to Custom Document w/ Purchase][7]
  * [Upload Custom Document w/ Purchase][8]
  * [Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Purchase][9]
**Ordering w/ Existing Document and Billing**

  * [Existing Document Credit Card Purchase][10]
  * [Existing Document with Mimeo Account Purchase][11]
These are based upon the requests I get most from developers and other people looking to integrate with [Mimeo][12].

Currently these widgets are just for demonstration. The Mimeo Marketplace team will soon be deploying similar tools as part of the marketplace.

So currently you have to build and deploy a version of [Mimeo Cloud Print][13] on your own server, and then these widgets would work for you.

You can find a [listing of these widgets][14] under the code section.

Hopefully they give you a idea of whats possible, if you have questions make sure and [let me know][15].
