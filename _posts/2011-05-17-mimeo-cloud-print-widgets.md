     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/widgets/bound-document-widget.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Widgets and other embeddable objects are the number one request we get at <a title="Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/">Mimeo Connect</a>. Everyone is busy these days, and they just need a quick way to enable users to build, purchase and <a title="print documents" href="http://www.mimeo.com">print documents</a> from anywhere. So I've started adding widgets to the <a title="Mimeo Cloud Print Platform" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/project_detail.php?ID=11">Mimeo Cloud Print Platform</a>. Right now I just have HTML widgets, but soon I will be adding JavaScript versions. I have eight widgets in 3 categories currently: <strong>Building and Purchasing Documents</strong>
</p>
<ul class="blue">
     <li>
          <a title="Link to Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/bp-link.php">Link to Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Upload Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/bp-upload.php">Upload Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/bp-preset.php">Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <strong>Purchasing Pre-Built Documents</strong>
</p>
<ul class="blue">
     <li>
          <a title="Link to Custom Document w/ Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/p-link.php">Link to Custom Document w/ Purchase</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Upload Custom Document w/ Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/p-upload.php">Upload Custom Document w/ Purchase</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/p-preset.php">Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Purchase</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <strong>Ordering w/ Existing Document and Billing</strong>
</p>
<ul class="blue">
     <li>
          <a title="Existing Document Credit Card Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/e-creditcard.php">Existing Document Credit Card Purchase</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Existing Document with Mimeo Account Purchase" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/widgets/e-mimeocredit.php">Existing Document with Mimeo Account Purchase</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These are based upon the requests I get most from developers and other people looking to integrate with <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a>. Currently these widgets are just for demonstration. The Mimeo Marketplace team will soon be deploying similar tools as part of the marketplace. So currently you have to build and deploy a version of <a title="Mimeo Cloud Print" href="http://developer.mimeo.comprojects/project_detail.php?ID=11">Mimeo Cloud Print</a> on your own server, and then these widgets would work for you. You can find a <a title="listing of widgets" href="http://developer.mimeo.commcp-widgets/index.php">listing of these widgets</a> under the code section. Hopefully they give you a idea of whats possible, if you have questions make sure and <a title="let me know" href="http://developer.mimeo.comsupport/contact.php">let me know</a>.
