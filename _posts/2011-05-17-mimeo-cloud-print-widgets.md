{% include JB/setup %}<p>Widgets and other embeddable objects are the number one request we get at Mimeo Connect.
Everyone is busy these days, and they just need a quick way to enable users to build, purchase and print documents from anywhere.
So I've started adding widgets to the Mimeo Cloud Print Platform.  Right now I just have HTML widgets, but soon I will be adding JavaScript versions.
I have eight widgets in 3 categories currently:
Building and Purchasing Documents

	Link to Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase
	Upload Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase
	Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Build and Purchase

Purchasing Pre-Built Documents

	Link to Custom Document w/ Purchase
	Upload Custom Document w/ Purchase
	Preset URL for Custom Document w/ Purchase

Ordering w/ Existing Document and Billing

	Existing Document Credit Card Purchase
	Existing Document with Mimeo Account Purchase

These are based upon the requests I get most from developers and other people looking to integrate with Mimeo.
Currently these widgets are just for demonstration.   The Mimeo Marketplace team will soon be deploying similar tools as part of the marketplace.
So currently you have to build and deploy a version of Mimeo Cloud Print on your own server, and then these widgets would work for you.
You can find a listing of these widgets under the code section.
Hopefully they give you a idea of whats possible, if you have questions make sure and let me know.</p>
