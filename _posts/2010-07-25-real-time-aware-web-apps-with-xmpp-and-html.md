I am spending time each week learning something new about HTML5 and brainstorming ways it can be applied in my every day business world.
Here are two areas I am researching:

	Using HTML 5 Web SQL Database and HTML5 Web Storage to make web applications run more efficiently by running them locally.
	Using HTML 5 Web Sockets and HTML 5 Server-Sent Events to allow my web applications to be real-time and aware as Internet is available.

I also just finished reading How to Create an XMPP-Driven Application in JavaScript. Using HTML 5 Web Sockets you can interface with any XMPP server and create a full-duplex communications channel within the web browser.
With all these improvements to HTML, HTML 5 seems like a logical choice for web and mobile application development.
Update: Also found this web socket extension for Apache Web Server.
