    Google has just announced Feedburner integration with Google Analytics.Now when you are using both Google Analytics and FeedBurner, you will see campaign attribution for item clicks tracked by
    your AdSense For Feeds or your Google FeedBurner account.Even many businesses that have fully embraced RSS as a tool in their online marketing toolbox dont track their feeds.It often gets lost in
    the mayhem of managing your online marketing campaign.Being able to see traffic from your RSS publishing side by side with other PPC and organic traffic will further push RSS into the mainstream.
