     Google has just announced <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2009/11/integration-with-feedburner.html">Feedburner integration with Google Analytics</a>. Now when you are using both Google Analytics and <a class="zem_slink" title="FeedBurner" rel="homepage" href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>, you will see campaign attribution for item clicks tracked by your AdSense For Feeds or your Google FeedBurner account. Even many businesses that have fully embraced RSS as a tool in their online marketing toolbox don't track their feeds. It often gets lost in the mayhem of managing your online marketing campaign. Being able to see traffic from your RSS publishing side by side with other PPC and organic traffic will further push RSS into the mainstream. I depend on RSS everyday to keep me informed. It is my school. Feed subscriptions are a critical way to drive traffic to your web site by syndicating your content. You should be understanding this traffic just as well as you do your other paid and organically generated traffic.
