{% include JB/setup %}<p>For some reason I stumble across Dion's articles all at once. They always pop up every couple weeks.<p></p>
Here is the latest one I stumbled across: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=218">The emerging case for open business methods</a><p></p>
I am a big advocate of companies opening up as much as possible. I think business trasnparency and openness can radically change your business in very positive ways.<p></p>
Dion provides some very organized information on evolving your business methodology, as usual.
