For some reason I stumble across Dion's articles all at once. They always pop up every couple weeks.

Here is the latest one I stumbled across: [The emerging case for open business methods][1]

I am a big advocate of companies opening up as much as possible. I think business trasnparency and openness can radically change your business in very positive ways.

Dion provides some very organized information on evolving your business methodology, as usual.
