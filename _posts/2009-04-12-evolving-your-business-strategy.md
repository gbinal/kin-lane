    For some reason I stumble across Dion's articles all at once. They always pop up every couple weeks. Here is the latest one I stumbled across: <a href=
    "http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=218">The emerging case for open business methods</a> I am a big advocate of companies opening up as much as possible. I think business trasnparency and
    openness can radically change your business in very positive ways. Dion provides some very organized information on evolving your business methodology, as usual.
