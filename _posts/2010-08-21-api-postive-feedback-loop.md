    A positive feedback loop can occur whenever an API becomes popular, it keeps becoming more and more popular due to network effects. The most important network effects are:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>API gets support by partners
      </li>
      <li>API gets support by vendors
      </li>
      <li>Developers are more likely to already know how to use it.
      </li>
    </ul>This feedback loop and network effect are the momentum you need to create in your API community. I'm working through this thought extracted from <a href=
