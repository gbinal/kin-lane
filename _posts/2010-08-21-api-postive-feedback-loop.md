{% include JB/setup %}A positive feedback loop can occur whenever an API becomes popular, it keeps becoming more and more popular due to network effects.
The most important network effects are:

	API gets support by partners
	API gets support by vendors
	Developers are more likely to already know how to use it.

This feedback loop and network effect are the momentum you need to create in your API community.
I'm working through this thought extracted from Why you should use OpenGL and not DirectX.
