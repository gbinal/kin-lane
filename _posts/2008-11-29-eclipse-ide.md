{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been using a combination of Dreamweaver and Notepad to do my code editing for a few years now.I use Dreamweaver because of employers mandating it mostly.I really dont like the application, or use many of the features.With my new role at WebEvents Global I started using Homesite which I dont much care for either.A couple developers are using Eclipse, so in order to support it I went ahead and downloaded it.</p>
