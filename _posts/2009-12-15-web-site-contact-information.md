I really like this contact information on this site I was researching tonight. The colors don't really appeal to me. It is the fact that their contact information is clearly:

	Available on every page at the bottom.
	Provides Email, Phone, Twitter, Instant Message
	Links newsletter information
	Links to blog

These are all mission critical ways of staying in touch with customers. Users should never have to search around a site to look for contact information.
