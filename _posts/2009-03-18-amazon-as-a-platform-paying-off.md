    My boss passed on a compliment today she received from our customer.We have a legacy CRM / Customer Care Tool that we launch every year.This system uses a large amount of data and is very web
    server and data server intensive.Historically I guess it had been pretty slow, and a chore to use somewhat.We are completely migrated to Amazon EC2 and S3 as our technology platform.
