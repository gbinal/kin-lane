    My boss passed on a compliment today she received from our customer. We have a legacy CRM / Customer Care Tool that we launch every year. This system uses a large amount of data and is very web
    server and data server intensive. Historically I guess it had been pretty slow, and a chore to use somewhat. We are completely migrated to Amazon EC2 and S3 as our technology platform. Things
    have been stable and I'm working hard on other new code and application related initiatives. To support this CRM solution I scaled up the web server to use a larger instance and already had the
    supporting database server on an x-large instance. The customer and their users raved about the performance of the application this year as opposed to complaining about it. Definitely feels good
    after all the stress of migrating the entire company infrastructure to the Amazon platform.
