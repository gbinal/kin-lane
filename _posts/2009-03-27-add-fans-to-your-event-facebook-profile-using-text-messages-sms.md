    Facebook is in the process of launching a new way for people to become fans of Facebook Pages using SMS text messaging. Now events, conferences and tradeshows will be able to get more Facebook
    fans by asking fans to text fan [your Facebook ID here] to FBOOK (32665). This is going to be a big deal for event marketers who've been looking for ways to accelerate their pages' growth. You
    can have people in a keynote, attending a session or visiting a booth become fans via their mobile devices in real-time. Currently, the text service is open only to some Facebook Pages. Look for
    a complete rollout soon. Another great social media marketing tool for events and conferences
