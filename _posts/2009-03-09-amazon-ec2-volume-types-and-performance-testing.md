I have not had much time to do performance testing on our recent [Amazon EC2][1] environment. We got our entire company migrated and stabilized in a completely [Amazon Web Services][2] based environment. And so far I love it..

So I am very thankful I came across this performance testing of different types of file system configurations setup on [Amazon][3] volumes.

Checkout the [Amazon Performance Testing here][4].

It is very helpful to have other considering using Amazon [Web Services][5] and EC2 as an alternative to their current ISP or hosting provider. Helps me make better educated decisions with the limited time and resources I have.
