I have not had much time to do performance testing on our recent Amazon EC2 environment. We got our entire company migrated and stabilized in a completely Amazon Web Services based environment. And so far I love it..
So I am very thankful I came across this performance testing of different types of file system configurations setup on Amazon volumes.
Checkout the Amazon Performance Testing here.
It is very helpful to have other considering using Amazon Web Services and EC2 as an alternative to their current ISP or hosting provider. Helps me make better educated decisions with the limited time and resources I have.
