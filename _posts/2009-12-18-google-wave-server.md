    I was going through the different areas of my Google Wave research this evening.It was time to learn more about the Google Wave Federated Protocol.I just havent had enough time to keep reading on
    the subject.So to update my research: Google released their open source version of the Google Wave Federation Prototype Server.PyGoWave Server is still going strong too.
