    I was going through the different areas of my Google Wave research this evening. It was time to learn more about the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/">Google Wave Federated Protocol</a>. I
    just haven't had enough time to keep reading on the subject. So to update my research:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Google released their open source version of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wave-protocol/wiki/Installation">Google Wave Federation Prototype Server</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pygowave-server/">PyGoWave Server</a> is still going strong too.
      </li>
    </ul>I don't see any other offerings at this point. The Google release is a Java application that conforms to XEP-0114, the Jabber Component Protocol. Without Java resources this isn't much of an
    option for me. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pygowave-server/">PyGoWave Server</a> is my best option. It is a Python implementation. I am not an expert in Python but I have dabbled. I would
    like to see a PHP Google Wave Server. So I am diving into the Google Wave Architecture documentation some more to get a stronger grasp of the <a href=
    "http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/google-wave-architecture">Google Wave Federation Architecture</a> and <a style="color: #4e7dbf; outline-style: none;" href=
    "http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/internal-client-server-protocol">Google Wave Data Model and Client-Server Protocol.</a>
