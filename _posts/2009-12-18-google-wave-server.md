I was going through the different areas of my Google Wave research this evening. It was time to learn more about the [Google Wave Federated Protocol][1]. I just haven't had enough time to keep reading on the subject.

So to update my research:

  * Google released their open source version of the [Google Wave Federation Prototype Server][2].
  * [PyGoWave Server][3] is still going strong too.
I don't see any other offerings at this point. The Google release is a Java application that conforms to XEP-0114, the Jabber Component Protocol. Without Java resources this isn't much of an option for me.

[PyGoWave Server][3] is my best option. It is a Python implementation. I am not an expert in Python but I have dabbled. I would like to see a PHP Google Wave Server.

So I am diving into the Google Wave Architecture documentation some more to get a stronger grasp of the [Google Wave Federation Architecture][4] and [Google Wave Data Model and Client-Server Protocol.][5]
