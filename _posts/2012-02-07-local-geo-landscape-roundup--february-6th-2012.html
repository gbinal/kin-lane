          <a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Creating Featured Stories with Action Specs</a> - (02/03/2012) - Recently we announced a new way of creating Featured Stories (previously "Sponsored Stories") on the Ads API by using action specs. These changes make the Ads API more flexible and will make it easier for developers to adapt to new story types as we launch them. We will be deprecating the old sponsored stories creative types as of May 1. Prior to this change Sponsored Stories were defined by choosing the correct Ad Creative type for the specific Sponsored Story type. E. g. a page like sponsored story was type 9, a page post like sponsored story was type 17 etc. This made it complicated for developers to incorporate new Sponsored Story types as each Sponsored Story required different fields per story type.

          <a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Platform Updates: Operation Developer Love</a> - (02/03/2012) - This week, we published a How-To on subscribing to data changes using the Real-time Updates API, as well as a games update on driving more discovery for games and shared Single Sign-On best practices for iOS and Android mobile developers. Lastly we announced a guide on How to Migrate your Application Profile Page. Ability to set the Password on Test Users We have long had a feature on the Developer App to enable you to create a new test user and to switch to it as needed. We've heard that it was still difficult for developers to test their mobile apps. To address this need, we have added the ability to set the password of the a user now from the Developer App.

          <a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">How-To: Migrate your App Profile Page</a> - (02/01/2012) - In December, we announced that we will be deprecating App Profile Pages on Feburary 1st. Many developers have asked for some tips on how to smoothly migrate their page. Below are some common issues, questions, and pro-tips for how to handle. What happens when users go to my deprecated App Profile Page? We recommend updating any links that you've shared to your App Profile Page to point to your new target Page.

His intent was to show how 84,000 data points could be easily viewed and navigated in one interactive piece. We think he did an amazing job using the clean, simple display to tell rich stories of company histories and the rise and fall of our country's top corporations. One company that stands out in our minds is Eastman Kodak, who enjoyed growing revenues and steady profitability for decades.

Nope - bring twice as many! Make sure you actually do something with the cards you pick up - I like WorldCard for scanning in cards. Pick Up All The Schwag Every company will be handing out free posters, stressballs, branded USB sticks, samples, and - in some cases - giving away phones. Take everything you can lay your hands on. Hand Sanitiser You're going to be shaking hands with thousands of people. Take along a bottle of hand sanitiser to help prevent picking up the MWC lurgy. Throat Lozenges Talking everyone through your app is hard on the vocal chords - especially if you've spent all night at the karaoke!
