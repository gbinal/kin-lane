I have been working on my [Google Cloud Print Proxy software in PHP][1] to make available for a wider audience.

When I get more time I intend to work on Ruby and Python versions.

Much of the work being done with the [Google Cloud Print Services Interface][2] is being done by major printer manufacturers in private.

I see some of this, through the conversation on the developers wiki, but they tend to not share very much

One developer shared his new [C# example for submitting a Google Cloud Print Job][3] last night. I wanted to share with everyone.
