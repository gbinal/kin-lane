    I’m unpacking all my notes from my time spent at the MIT Media Lab this last weekend.&nbsp;One of the byproducts of hanging out with so many smart people is I end up with all kind of great ideas,
    and I know better than to think I can do them all myself, so I put my ideas out on the web for anyone to run with.My project from theHackathon this weekend was #ReclaimYourDomain, which I’ll
    write about in detail separately, but the overall project objective was to educate people about: Owning Their Own Domain Taking Control Of Their Cotent The project is focused on empowering people
    in these areas by providing not just tools, but also education.I will begin educating people about these concepts by showing them how to start a blog, and move into other service areas later.One
    service area that would be further down on my roadmap, but I would like to put the idea out there today, is the concept of a personal legal storage locker for terms of use(TOS), non-disclosure
    agreements(NDA) and the other common legal arrangements we all encounter with on a daily basis.
