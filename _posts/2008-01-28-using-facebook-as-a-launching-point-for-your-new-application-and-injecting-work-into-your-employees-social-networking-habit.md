{% include JB/setup %}<p>Was reading the post on Techcrunch this morning called Huddle uses new apps and Facebook to take on Basecamp. Its interesting on several levels to see another Basecamp competitor as well as someone leverage facebook as a marketing tool for their new web applications.  How launching a Facebook can be a tool to drive new users to your application.I think it is also very interesting from the usage of Facebook and other social networks in the workplace.  I mentioned the article in the TimesOnline called Learn to love social network sites about workplace usage of social networks.  Huddles new application introduces potential value for the workplace in applications that run in social networks.I keep saying how companies need to embrace employees usage of social networks from a moral standpoint, work efficiency, and from their social media marketing strategy.</p>
