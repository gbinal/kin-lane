    I got really busy over April and May and neglected a some of my infrastructure.Im doing a thorough review / audit of all my Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure.In this era of Cloud
    Computing my review does not stop at workstations, servers and printers.All services provided by 3rd party providers are included in my IT plan.Im a little ahead of the curve because I feel
    confident in using the cloud more than other IT managers.
