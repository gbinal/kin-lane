{% include JB/setup %}I have had this discussion with a few people at different times. I have also seen other people talking about getting information on their commenting.I would like all comments I make on public sites to tracked as part of my history.  I want to know what I am saying out there.Just like my search history I want to see each and everyday what I say to the general public at large.Should of course be able to search this information and post cloud views of I am doing out there.I post comments on Flickr, Youtube, Blogs, Forums, Q&amp;A Site and many other place.I should be able to see what I have done for the day.
