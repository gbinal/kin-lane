    If I want a job or some project work, why do I have to look on so many networks.Sure I can find all the places I want to look these days and accumulate some RSS feeds and monitor these
    channels.However why should I?I should just turn on the available light and based upon my resume, work history and profile the work just comes to me.It knows how many hours I want and what sort
    of situation I am available for.
