Came across a blog posting for a [new social network][1] / platform call [Smibs][2]. We ahead and signed up for it. I am always curious how fast these networks will grow.

I monitor my Google rankings pretty thoroughly. Curious to see how fast it rises in the ranks.

Sometimes I will see them popup on my first page pretty quickly. Sometimes I never see them at all.

It is an interesting approach to social networking. I got my basic profile in there, I will play with more later. (maybe)
