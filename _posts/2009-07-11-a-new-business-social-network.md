    Came across a blog posting for a <a href="http://smibs.com">new social network</a> / platform call <a href="Smibs">Smibs</a>. We ahead and signed up for it. I am always curious how fast these
    networks will grow. I monitor my Google rankings pretty thoroughly. Curious to see how fast it rises in the ranks. Sometimes I will see them popup on my first page pretty quickly. Sometimes I
    never see them at all. It is an interesting approach to social networking. I got my basic profile in there, I will play with more later. (maybe)
