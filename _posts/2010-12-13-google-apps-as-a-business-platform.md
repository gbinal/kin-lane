In a little over three weeks Google has released 14 of their regular web applications as part of the Google Apps cloud platform.
Now in addition to the core email, docs, calendar, sites, and chat you have 14 new web applications:

	Google Custom Search
	Google Website Optimizer
	Google Checkout
	Google Analytics
	Google Places
	Google SketcUp &amp; 3D Warehouse
	Google Translator Toolkit
	Youtube
	Google Alerts
	Google Adwords
	Google Finance
	Blogger
	Google Voice
	Google Reader

I have been waiting for a couple of these apps to be added, like Google Reader and Google Voice. A few of the other just make sense, you want to have your Checkout, Analytics and Adwords part of your core business business account.
All of these apps, plus the Google Apps Marketplace really makes Google Apps a complete business platform.
