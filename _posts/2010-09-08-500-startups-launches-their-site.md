Seed funding and startups isn't something I normally write about on my blog. I tend to be more vocal about the technology, than the money.

Through exposure from [Audrey][1] and the [ReadWriteStart Channel][2] I am paying more attention to this world again. I have plenty of business planning exposure from working at [Palo Alto Software][3], but always felt like I had moved on during that time and didn't really jive with the "business planning" community.

[500 Startups][4] launched their new web site today. I'm impressed with Dave McClue's approach to tech start-up financing and the portfolio of tech startups they have: <img class="alignnone c1" title="500 Startups" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/500-startups.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

I am spending more time watching the latest generation of technology startups. Slideshare, Twilio and Rapportive are three I am watching.

I had the pleasure of working with Christine Tsai, one of the 500 Startup team members during her time at Google, we worked on Google I/O together.

I will be watching the existing and new tech startups that [500 Startups][4] invest in.
