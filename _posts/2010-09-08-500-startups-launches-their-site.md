{% include JB/setup %}<p>Seed funding and startups isnt something I normally write about on my blog.I tend to be more vocal about the technology, than the money.Through exposure from Audrey and the ReadWriteStart Channel I am paying more attention to this world again.I have plenty of business planning exposure from working at Palo Alto Software, but always felt like I had moved on during that time and didnt really jive with the business planning community.500 Startups launched their new web site today.</p>
