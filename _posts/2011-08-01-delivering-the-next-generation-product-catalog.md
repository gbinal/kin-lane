{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im spending some time brainstorming the next generation of product catalogs with a new platform partner Moodstocks.These are just a few of my preliminary thoughts on the subject.Using the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API you can print a dynamically generated product catalog in a magazine (saddle stitch) or perfect bound format.Products can be pulled directly from your live product catalog, used to generated a print catalog in PDF format, and sent to the Mimeo API for printing and mailing.This type of print on demand product catalog is an ideal way to efficiently print a product catalog that is always up to date, without large print runs and warehousing.</p>
