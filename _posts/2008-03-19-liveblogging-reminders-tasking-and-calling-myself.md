    I have been using Jott for that last few months to record tasks, record events, publish blogs, and other general communications by calling Jott and leaving a voice mail or "jott" and it
    translates and sends to the link that I dictate.<br />
    <br />
    I am pioneering using this for live blogging of events and sending out user generate reporters.<br />
    <br />
    Today I came across Utterz which is a simlar to Jott, but adds in the pictures and videos but utilizes a larger list of links you can post to.<br />
    <br />
    Utterz seems like a true live blogging tool, where Jott seems like a personal assistant and publishing tool.
