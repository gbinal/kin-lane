I was just going through my [Google Webmaster Tools][1], Google Analytics, and Feedburner stats. I noticed in my [Google Webmaster Tools][1] that I come up number 7 in Google Search for [Enterprise 2.0][2]. So I went to Google and typed it in.

Sure enough I'm number 5 for [Enterprise 2.0][2]. I even beat out the [Andrew McAfee's Blog][3], and he is the godfather of Enterprise 2.0.

I don't consider myself an expert in [Enterprise 2.0][3], but I think many of the topics I research and discuss are extremely relevant to enterprise. And since I do manage event technology for SAP and Google, that I am going to come up relevant.

Not sure how long it will last, but its very cool.
