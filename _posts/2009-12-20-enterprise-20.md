{% include JB/setup %}I was just going through my Google Webmaster Tools, Google Analytics, and Feedburner stats. I noticed in my Google Webmaster Tools that I come up number 7 in Google Search for Enterprise 2.0. So I went to Google and typed it in.
Sure enough I'm number 5 for Enterprise 2.0. I even beat out the Andrew McAfee's Blog, and he is the godfather of Enterprise 2.0.
I don't consider myself an expert in Enterprise 2.0, but I think many of the topics I research and discuss are extremely relevant to enterprise. And since I do manage event technology for SAP and Google, that I am going to come up relevant.
Not sure how long it will last, but its very cool.
