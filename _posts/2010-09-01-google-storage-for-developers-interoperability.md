    I finally got my Google Storage for Developers email invite the other day.They promised attendees of Google I/O would get them quicker, it took 3 months.I clicked on the link in my email and
    requested my keys and logged into the Google Storage Manager.It has a pretty basic interface for managing your buckets and objects.Just like Amazon S3.
