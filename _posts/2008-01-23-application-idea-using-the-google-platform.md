{% include JB/setup %}<p>Had a new idea on how to use the Google Platform today.Reading so much about micro-blogging and twitter these days in the blogosphere.Was reading how non-profits can use micro-blogging and how it could be used in disaster and emergency scenarios until I read how Twitter failed during the MacWorld conference.So I was building upon an old idea on how you could use Google Notebook for micro-blogging and I thought even better you could use Google Spreadsheets.You could build a widget or firefox add-on for micro-blogging and it would store all your entries for a day in a single spreadsheet.</p>
