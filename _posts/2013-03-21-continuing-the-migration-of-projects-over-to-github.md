    Iâ€™m continuing the migration of all my projects to run on Github.Eventually all public areas of my site will run as static, published Github pages and supporting back-end repositories.Last night
    I migrated API aggregation, Backend as a Service, Reciprocity and Real-Time providers using a version of my Hacker Storytelling format.While apievangelist.com will still remain the master doorway
    to all my work, each project will live under its own subdomain and Github repository.
