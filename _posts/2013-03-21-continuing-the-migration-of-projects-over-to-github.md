{% include JB/setup %}<p>I&rsquo;m continuing the migration of all my projects to run on Github.Eventually all public areas of my site will run as static, published Github pages and supporting back-end repositories.Last night I migrated API aggregation, Backend as a Service, Reciprocity and Real-Time providers using a version of my Hacker Storytelling format.While apievangelist.com will still remain the master doorway to all my work, each project will live under its own subdomain and Github repository.</p>
