    This is from a response to a question I came across on LinkedIn Answers.I thought I should syndicate it here: There are many different approaches to using Facebook for business that I could go
    into depending on the industry your in and the audience you looking to engage.These variables heavily influence how you would use Facebook.At this point I would say the two top uses of Facebook
    that I encourage ALL business owners to understand are: 1) Facebook Connect 2) Share Using Facebook.These two tools offer the most value to your business and to your audience.
