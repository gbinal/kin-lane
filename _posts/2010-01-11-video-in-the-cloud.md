I was looking for an [open source image gallery solution][1] for a friend the other night. Tonight after reading [The Coming Tornado: Cloud in the Enterprise][2]. I got into researching a couple of other areas of open source or cloud tools that I can add to my IT cloud stack.

I came across [Panda][3], an [open source video sharing application][4]. I was going to install [Plogger][5], the image gallery tool I found the other night, on an Amazon EC2 instance and make an AMI out of it. So I could share it with the community and offer a [cloud based image gallery tool][6].

So tonight when I started to look for an open source video solution I thought I would create an Amazon AMI from this too. However the ingenious folks building Panda have already seen the future. Very nice.

Anyways, [Panda][3] is a great addition to my IT cloud stack in the SaaS category.
