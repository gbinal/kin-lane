    I was looking for an open source image gallery solution for a friend the other night.Tonight after reading The Coming Tornado: Cloud in the Enterprise.I got into researching a couple of other
    areas of open source or cloud tools that I can add to my IT cloud stack.I came across Panda, an open source video sharing application.I was going to install Plogger, the image gallery tool I
    found the other night, on an Amazon EC2 instance and make an AMI out of it.
