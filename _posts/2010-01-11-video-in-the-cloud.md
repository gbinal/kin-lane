     I was looking for an open source image gallery solution for a friend the other night. Tonight after reading The Coming Tornado: Cloud in the Enterprise. I got into researching a couple of other areas of open source or cloud tools that I can add to my IT cloud stack. I came across Panda, an open source video sharing application. I was going to install Plogger, the image gallery tool I found the other night, on an Amazon EC2 instance and make an AMI out of it. So I could share it with the community and offer a cloud based image gallery tool. So tonight when I started to look for an open source video solution I thought I would create an Amazon AMI from this too. However the ingenious folks building Panda have already seen the future. Very nice. Anyways, Panda is a great addition to my IT cloud stack in the SaaS category.
