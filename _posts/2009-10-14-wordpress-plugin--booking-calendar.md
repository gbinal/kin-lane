I am always impressed with where you can take [Wordpress][1] as a web site management tool. It goes well beyond just being a blogging platform or even a simple [content management system][2].

With the Plugin directory a site owner can take it a long way. There are thousands of simple plugins available providing different functionality.

However I am coming across more Free Premium plugins that give you introductory functionality and an upsell for more features.

I like this model. I was just checking out [Booking Calendar Wordpress Plugin][3]. It has a Basic and Pro version. I don't have any need for calendaring on my blog, but being in the events industry I see a lot of simple sites that could use this type of functionality.

I'm going to install the FREE just to play with and see what it offers.
