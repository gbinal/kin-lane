{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am always impressed with where you can take Wordpress as a web site management tool.It goes well beyond just being a blogging platform or even a simple content management system.With the Plugin directory a site owner can take it a long way.There are thousands of simple plugins available providing different functionality.However I am coming across more Free + Premium plugins that give you introductory functionality and an upsell for more features.</p>
