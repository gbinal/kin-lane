{% include JB/setup %}<p>Amazon Web Services increased the size limit for objects you can store on Amazon S3 from 1TB to 5TB today.
In order to upload larger objects they require you to use the new Multipart Upload API. This uploader allows you to upload the object in parts, increasing the chances it will finisih.
I don't personally have any 1 TB files laying around, let alone a 5TB files, but I'm sure this opens up a lot of new possibilities for using Amazon Web Service for scientific data or media content.</p>
