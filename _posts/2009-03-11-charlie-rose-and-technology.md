    I am really impressed with the Charlie Rose show lately.I have always enjoyed his show and his lineup of guests.However in the last year his lineup of technology leaders and visionary is
    impressive.What is even more impressive is his ability to know whats going on.He doesnt just have a list of quality questions.
