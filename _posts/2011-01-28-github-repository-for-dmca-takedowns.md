You can tell we are in a seriously volatile time, and the Internet is the center of it.

With revolutions in Middle East, country-wide Internet blackout, and Wikileaks, everyone is on edge, waiting for whats next.
Github the social coding repository site has started posting the DMCA takedowns the company receives for content osting on their platform.
It is great to see companies be completely transparent about these copyright, patent, 1st amendment, and other technology related issues.
I think it is important for companies to be as transparent as they can, so that their userbase is informed and can help support them (or not) as they face these industry and Government pressures.
