{% include JB/setup %}<p>As Im working on different cloud printing solutions I am considering the practical use of these technologies in conjunction with Mimeo commercial printing.One area I see a very practical use of cloud printing, is developing a commercial cloud print queue.An individual or a group of people could drop all print jobs into a cloud based commercial print queue.These documents can come from Google Docs, Box.net, Dropbox or any other cloud storage provider.</p>
