{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reading through my blogs today and came across the post from Download Squad on Amazon Launches Software Downloads.I dug around a little more and saw where you can manager your Media Library on Amazon including E-Docs, Amazon Shorts, Unbox Videos, Kindle Books, Kindle Newspapers, Kindle Blogs, Kindle Blogs, Amazon Mp3 and Software Downloads.Found it interesting that they give you an area to manage all of your digital material that you purchase through Amazon as a customer.Then I thought well there must be a flip side to this service and logged into my Amazon Web Services account and foudn I could sign up for the Amazon Digital Text Platform.This allows me as a publisher to publish my digital text content.</p>
