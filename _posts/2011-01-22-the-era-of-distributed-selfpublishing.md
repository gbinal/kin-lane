Its interesting to watch [self-publishing][1] move mainstream and gain more acceptance. The conversation seems to be moving from, Is self-publishing a viable option? to Self-publishing is the way to go!.

Services like [Lulu.com][2] and [Amazon self publishing][3] are empowering many authors to self-publish their works and handle the business side of getting their work sold. Keeping more of the profits in their pockets. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/open-book.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /> This is definitely a viable option for many authors, however I think there will always be a place for niche publishing houses. Not every author is up for the task of promoting their own [Book][1].

With the acceptance of self-publishing, the evolution of self-publishing technologies like [Mimeo][4] Connect [Cloud Print][5], we will see a lot more publishing houses pop up. These small publishers will provide distribution, marketing, and on-demand or small run publishing services.

I would like to see more open-source projects that support self-publishing platforms for books, photos, posters, cards and other popular print formats. This would provide a platform for aspiring publishers that have connections or a expertise in a particular format or subject area.

Publishers could employ open-source publishing platforms that utilize cloud print APIs to get their products printed, then provide additional services beyond just [printing][1] for their customers. This would leave their authors to do what they do best. These niche publishers could provide their authors with the attention they need and cater to a specific audiences. Long-tail audiences that larger self-publishing providers don't have the time for or expertise in.

I think we are slowly entering an era of distributed self-publishing, where publishing is being democratized using new publishing platforms and cloud print APIs.
