    I just setup My Documents folder on my computer to automatically backup to Amazon S3 every night.I have kind of been half way doing this as I can, but with a recent laptop failure it became much
    more of an issue.I had bought a new el cheapo laptop from Best Buy.and 3 months later the harddrive failed.They were able to recover my data, but there were things that could have been lost
    forever.
