I just got a new levovo Laptop.  It was presetup with Windows XP.It took me 30 minutes flat to setup completely for my needs.Installed my web development environment.Installed my database development environment.Installed Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger.Installed Firefox.Done, everything else I do is web-based.  All my email, docs, files, everything is either on Google, Amazon Web Services or some other Web Service.Almost there in accomplishing my goal in living online.Man I love it.
