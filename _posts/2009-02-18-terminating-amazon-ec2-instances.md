    There are many features that operating in the clouds using Amazon EC2 brings to the table.Although there are two areas that make me so nervous: 1) Terminating an Instance 2) Release IP Address
    Now I cover my ass with a rigorous backup process and creating AMI of my key production and development instances.However still terminating an instance always makes me soooo nervous.Its just so
    permanent and when you have large applications depending on databases, file servers, svn servers, etc it makes you queezy to push that button.Ok.
