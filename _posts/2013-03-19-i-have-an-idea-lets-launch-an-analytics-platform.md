During my monitoring for the [API stack][1] this last week, I noticed that both [Parse][2] and [New Relic][3] had launched mobile analytics platforms. I’ve been tracking on various [API driven analytics platforms][4], and after seeing both Parse and New Relic launch their offerings, I thought, who else is doing this?

Here are a few of the analytics platforms that launched in the last 30 days:

  * 02/21/2013 -[ TEOCO Launches INrange™ Location-Based Predictive Analytics Solution][5]
  * 02/26/2013 - [IBM Launches Cloud-Based Analytics and Mobile Initiatives for Global Ecosystem to Capture New Markets][6]
  * 02/26/2013 - [Trinity Pharma Solutions Launches Mobile Analytics Platform][7]
  * 02/26/2013 - [Trinity Pharma's AgileM Delivers the First Mobile Analytics Solution for Life Sciences ][8]
  * 02/26/2013 - [Mobile App for Anametrix Marketing Analytics Platform Launches in iOS, Android and BlackBerry App Stores][9]
  * 03/05/2013 - [Voltari Launches Voltari Auto – Predictive Analytics for Ad Targeting Fueled by Polk Automotive Data][10]
  * 03/07/2013 - [Analytics firm Applause launches the Applause Index][11]
  * 03/12/2013 - [Introducing Pinterest Web Analytics][12]
  * 03/12/2013 - [Houzz Launches New Analytics Tool for Remodeling and Design Professionals Participating in Pro Program][13]
  * 03/19/2013 - [App Annie launches Amazon Appstore analytics][14]

It seems that everyone is getting pretty excited about the growth of big data and mobile. Analytics seems to be the latest boom area, something I will add to my list of [API driven trends][15] I’m monitoring.
