Since Sencha Animator generates pure CSS3 its output is customizable, allowing you to add and modify the CSS3 code without hand writing thousands of lines of CSS.Though it doesnt replace all uses of Flash, it can replace several key areas including:

	Web Animations
	Advertisements
	Splash Screens
	General Web Content

Since Sencha Animator outputs HTML5 / CSS3, it works on major mobile platforms include IPhone, IPad, Android, and Blackberry OS6.Its just a preview now, and when released they say it will be priced in the low hundreds of dollars.Well have to keep an eye on it.</p>
