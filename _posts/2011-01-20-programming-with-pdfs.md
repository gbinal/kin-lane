    When it comes to developing for Print applications you need to be able to programmatically manipulate images.Currently with Mimeo, ultimately everything needs to be in a PDF format before it gets
    sent to the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.Whether its a report, book, magazine, photo or poster it will have to be PDF document at some point.Hopefully soon we will accept a wider range of
    formats.:) I spent some time today looking to see what my options are when it comes to working with PDFs.
