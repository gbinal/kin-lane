{% include JB/setup %}When it comes to Google Wave, it can be tough to find truly new perspectives on how it works and its potential usage and adoption. I just finished reading a great post by Anil Dash called What Works: The Web Way vs. The Wave Way.
He provides a perspective and analysis of Google Wave that left me thinking rather than just feeling I read recycled thoughts on Google Wave.
There is a lot of challenges ahead of Google Wave before it achieves the "web changing" status everyone has given it.
He lays this out very well. Thanks Anil.
