    When it comes to Google Wave, it can be tough to find truly new perspectives on how it works and its potential usage and adoption.I just finished reading a great post by Anil Dash called What
    Works: The Web Way vs.The Wave Way.He provides a perspective and analysis of Google Wave that left me thinking rather than just feeling I read recycled thoughts on Google Wave.There is a lot of
    challenges ahead of Google Wave before it achieves the web changing status everyone has given it.
