    In every company I work for we deal with resource shortages all over the place, either due to budgetary constraints or lack of skilled talent in the area.Either way many projects suffer and take
    a lot of time.I was reading a post from TED today on new crowdsourcing site Kluster.Its another new attempt at harnessing the power of the crowd and putting it to use to create a better solution
    to a problem.It really allows you to tap a small or large group of people around a marketing idea, product launch or other viral style campaign.
