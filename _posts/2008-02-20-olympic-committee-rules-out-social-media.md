Was just reading a post on [ReadWriteWeb][1] about [Olympic Committe Rules Revealed: No Posting of Media Allowed.][2]

They say they are embracing blogging because it is a form of personal expression and not a form of journalism.

However they are prohibiting the usage of pictures, sound or moving images in any blog or other method.

It is amazing that there are still major groups that do not understand the value of social media and want to control and license everything that happens.

I am working in social media more and more in the outdoor space with [Altrec.com][3] and [GreatOutdoors.com][4] and I am realizing the huge value of social media to sporting and outdoor events.

It is sad to see the Olympic committee feel this way.
