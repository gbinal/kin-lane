    Today is the first birthday of the Google Apps Marketplace, and what better time to talk about the significance of application ecosystems.I would call Google Apps Marketplace a success, even
    though many Internet users may not even know it exists.As a developer I understand the power of being able to integrate with a larger platform ecosystem.Google Apps Marketplace enables me to
    build an application that users to add to their Google Apps account.I can do this with other ecosystems like Facebook, Evernote and Box.
