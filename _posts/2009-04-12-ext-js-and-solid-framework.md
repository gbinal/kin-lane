{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have blogged about my usage of EXT JS Framework.I am adopting it for usage at my company right now and plotting the next stages in our event management software products.It has taken me some considerable work to learn how EXT JS works and how to adopt it for the best usage throughout our software.Some simple things just become real hard for me to do.However the separation of the presentation layer is awesome.</p>
