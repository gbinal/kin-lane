    I am taking some time and writing down my image management strategy to share with Audrey.I have a specific process and set of tools I use to manage images I use across my Kin Lane Blog, API
    Evangelist Blog and my Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and other online properties.I store all my images centrally at Amazon S3.This may not be an ideal solution for everyone, but it works for me.Its
    a complete storage area for all my images, audio, video and other documents.
