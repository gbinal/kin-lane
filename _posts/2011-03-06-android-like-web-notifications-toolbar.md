<img src="http://www.webmonkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/w3c_main-300x45.png" alt="" align="right" />I just had a new idea for a startup. I'm in love with everything about technology startups except actually starting another one myself.

So I kind of work the opposite of the rest of Silicon Valley, when I have an idea I just put it out there on the open Internet.

I'm reading [Scott's analysis of theWeb Notifications API][1] over at [webmonkey][2].

I like my [Google Gmail notifications][3]. I also like the way Android does mobile notifications. So does [Fred Wilson][4].

Somebodyneeds to do a Software as a Service (SaaS) startup dedicated to simplifying webnotifications.

Make it plug and play for other app developers and web site owners to implement web notifications, similar to what [Janrain has done for OpenID][5].

Allow users to get a web notification toolbar at the top of their browser, something like the new [Wordpress admin bar][6], to receive web updates from all their accounts.

It would be in their browser on their laptop, mobile phone, and tablets.

Keep it simple, [do one thing well][7], stay in tune with where each browser is going with their support for the [Web Notifications API][8], and I'm sure someone will invest in you.

Maybe [Union Square Ventures][9]? Fred believes _"[mobile notifications are one of the biggest game changers to come along in our world recently][10]"_.
