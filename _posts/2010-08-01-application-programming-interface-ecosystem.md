Last night I went through 25 of the top [Application Programming Interfaces (API)][1], and documented what type of services they offer as part of their API Ecoystem. I'm trying to get a handle on best approaches to delivering an API. I'm still processing this information but so far I have these API Ecosystem building blocks:

**API Overview**

  * Dashboard
  * Overview of the API
  * Quick Start
**Account / Developer Related**

  * API / Application Registration
  * Account Management
  * Settings
**API /** **Code / Applications**

  * API Reference
  * Script Libraries
  * Code Share
  * Widgets
  * Marketplace
**Support Related**

  * Bug Report / Ticket System
  * Social Network
  * Forum
  * FAQ
**Resources / Informational**

  * Articles
  * Blog w/ RSS Feeds
  * Email List Serve
  * Calendar
  * Wiki
  * Tutorials
  * Case Studies
  * White Papers
  * Showcase
  * Ideas
**Other Tools / Not Categorized**

  * Metrics / Reporting
  * Roadmap
  * Status Dashboard
  * Developers for Hire
  * Partners
  * Security
  * Pricing / Rate Limits
  * Branding Guidelines
  * Terms of Use
This list represents most of the tools provided to partners, developers and API consumers through existing top APIs. It is interesting to see how different players approach this area of their business. Some its their only business.

I can't rave enough about how [Salesforce][2] delivers their API. They are definitely the industry standard for delivering a [highly sophisticated API Ecosystem][3] with their [Software as a Service (SaaS)][4].
