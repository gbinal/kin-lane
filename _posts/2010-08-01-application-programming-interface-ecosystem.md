Last night I went through 25 of the top Application Programming Interfaces (API), and documented what type of services they offer as part of their API Ecoystem. I'm trying to get a handle on best approaches to delivering an API. I'm still processing this information but so far I have these API Ecosystem building blocks:



API Overview

	Dashboard
	Overview of the API
	Quick Start

Account / Developer Related

	API / Application Registration
	Account Management
	Settings

API / Code / Applications

	API Reference
	Script Libraries
	Code Share
	Widgets
	Marketplace

Support Related

	Bug Report / Ticket System
	Social Network
	Forum
	FAQ


Resources / Informational

	Articles
	Blog w/ RSS Feeds
	Email List Serve
	Calendar
	Wiki
	Tutorials
	Case Studies
	White Papers
	Showcase
	Ideas

Other Tools / Not Categorized

	Metrics / Reporting
	Roadmap
	Status Dashboard
	Developers for Hire
	Partners
	Security
	Pricing / Rate Limits
	Branding Guidelines
	Terms of Use





This list represents most of the tools provided to partners, developers and API consumers through existing top APIs. It is interesting to see how different players approach this area of their business. Some its their only business.
I can't rave enough about how Salesforce delivers their API. They are definitely the industry standard for delivering a highly sophisticated API Ecosystem with their Software as a Service (SaaS).
