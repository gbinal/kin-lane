I spoke last night at the [UOAMA][1] which is a student run marketing organization that aims to connect students with professional marketers and offer insight into the marketing profession through the avenues of solid leadership, strong communication, real-world marketing experience, and charitable involvement.

I spoke on the topic of [online marketing and social media marketing][2]. Unfortunately my wife Ishi couldn't be there.

It was an interesting group of young students, and an interesting group.

Here is the outline I used for my speech:
