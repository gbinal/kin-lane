{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spoke last night at the UOAMA which is a student run marketing organization that aims to connect students with professional marketers and offer insight into the marketing profession through the avenues of solid leadership, strong communication, real-world marketing experience, and charitable involvement.I spoke on the topic of online marketing and social media marketing.Unfortunately my wife Ishi couldnt be there.It was an interesting group of young students, and an interesting group.Here is the outline I used for my speech:Your WebsiteMake an outline for your siteKeep your goals simple in everything you doBe involved with planning with your designerHave control, ask for a content management system (CMS)Understand and have control over your META tagsPay for good Internet hostingBuy your own domain nameUse a website traffic / analytics packageName your pages and folders using keyword rich namesBulleted and ordered listsSimple, readable content that gets to the pointKeep design readable, appropriate for audience and accessible across all platforms, browsers.</p>
