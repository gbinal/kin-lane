{% include JB/setup %}I'm going through the my list of existing and potential self-publishing and print-on-demand applications.   First on my list is the fotobooks the Facebook social print application.
Its a pretty straightforward app allowing you to organize photos from your Facebook albums into small photo books.

With 2 clicks you can have the application installed in your Facebook profile:

	Click Getting Started from fotobooks home page
	Allow the applications request for permissions

The application is now installed and you can assemble and order a fotobook in 7 steps:

	Click create new book
	Select cover design, and give book a title
	Drag photos from albums onto 19 pages of your fotobook
	Preview your fotobook
	Enter order quantity and delivery
	Enter shipping and billing information
	Pay $5.99 for the book with paypal express or credit card

The fotobooks application is a great example of the next generation of social publishing.  I have hit a point of exhaustion with digital photos and social sharing of my photos.  Social tools like Instagr.am and fotobooks have renewed my energy for taking photos.
fotobooks is first on my list of applications to showcase what is possible with the Mimeo Connect Print API platform.  It is an existing application, stay tuned for more examples, and random ideas I come up with in my adventures as Mimeo Connect API Evangelist.
