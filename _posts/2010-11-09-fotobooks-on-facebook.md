{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im going through the my list of existing and potential self-publishing and print-on-demand applications.First on my list is the fotobooks the Facebook social print application.Its a pretty straightforward app allowing you to organize photos from your Facebook albums into small photo books.With 2 clicks you can have the application installed in your Facebook profile:

	Click Getting Started from fotobooks home page
	Allow the applications request for permissions

The application is now installed and you can assemble and order a fotobook in 7 steps:

	Click create new book
	Select cover design, and give book a title
	Drag photos from albums onto 19 pages of your fotobook
	Preview your fotobook
	Enter order quantity and delivery
	Enter shipping and billing information
	Pay $5.99 for the book with paypal express or credit card

The fotobooks application is a great example of the next generation of social publishing.</p>
