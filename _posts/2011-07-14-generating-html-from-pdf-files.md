{% include JB/setup %}<p>I came across a new tool this week called PDFMasher.PDFMasher converts PDF files containing text into HTML files.Most e-Book readers support PDF file, but doesnt create a very good user experience because there is limit control over formatting, such as font sizes.PDF on e-Book readers also doesnt allow for annotations.PDFMasher processes PDFs and asks the user about the role of each section of text in an efficient manner.</p>
