I was looking for some nice CSS styling for text and memo boxes tonight. I stumbled across [CSS Portal][1].

They have some great information to improve your CSS skils. I found some greate [CSS text boxes][2], [CSS memo boxes][3], and [CSS buttons][4].

There is a lot more. Recommend checking it out. Great quick CSS reference
