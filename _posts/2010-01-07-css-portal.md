     I was looking for some nice CSS styling for text and memo boxes tonight. I stumbled across <a href="http://www.cssportal.com/">CSS Portal</a>. They have some great information to improve your CSS skils. I found some greate <a href="http://www.cssportal.com/form-elements/text-box.htm">CSS text boxes</a>, <a href="http://www.cssportal.com/form-elements/text-area.htm">CSS memo boxes</a>, and <a href="http://www.cssportal.com/form-elements/form-buttons.htm">CSS buttons</a>. There is a lot more. Recommend checking it out. Great quick CSS reference
