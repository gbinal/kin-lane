I was looking for some nice CSS styling for text and memo boxes tonight. I stumbled across CSS Portal.
They have some great information to improve your CSS skils. I found some greate CSS text boxes, CSS memo boxes, and CSS buttons.
There is a lot more. Recommend checking it out. Great quick CSS reference
