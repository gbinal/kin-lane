{% include JB/setup %}<p>I read a great post recently about how a company called Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts for the products they make.It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality.&nbsp;I wrote about the concept of a 3D printed junk drawer last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs.Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways.&nbsp;Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products?</p>
