     Everyone is a little intimidated and overwhelmed about where to start with your <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com/">social media marketing campaign</a>. There are so many sites and so few metrics for evaluating your success.
     <br />
     <br />
     You really can't ignore social media for your company anymore, if you do your competitors are going to eat your lunch. So where do you start?
     <br />
     <br />
     <a href="http://www.insidecrm.com/">InsideCRM</a> just released a great list of <a href="http://www.insidecrm.com/features/50-social-sites-012808/">50 social media sites that every business needs a presence on</a>.
     <br />
     <br />
     It is a pretty comprehensive list with a great introduction to each. They cover the following types of Social Network Sites:<strong><br /></strong>
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong><span class="c1">Social-Media/Social-Bookmarking Sites</span></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><span class="c1">Professional-Networking Sites</span></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><span class="c1">Niche Social-Media Sites</span></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><span class="c1">General Social-Media Sites</span></strong>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><span class="c1">Job Sites</span></strong>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     It is probably more sites than the average business can handle, but it is a great place to start.
