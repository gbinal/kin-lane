Everyone is a little intimidated and overwhelmed about where to start with your [social media marketing campaign][1]. There are so many sites and so few metrics for evaluating your success.

You really can't ignore social media for your company anymore, if you do your competitors are going to eat your lunch. So where do you start?

[InsideCRM][2] just released a great list of [50 social media sites that every business needs a presence on][3].

It is a pretty comprehensive list with a great introduction to each. They cover the following types of Social Network Sites:**
**

  * **Social-Media/Social-Bookmarking Sites**
  * **Professional-Networking Sites**
  * **Niche Social-Media Sites**
  * **General Social-Media Sites**
  * **Job Sites**
It is probably more sites than the average business can handle, but it is a great place to start.
