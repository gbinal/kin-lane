    Was just reading a post on Mashable about Google: Browser is the Platform of the Future, Even on Mobiles.Reading this and continuing my journey to understand mobile platforms, primarily IPhone,
    Blackberry, and Android.Which I feel are the big players you should consider these while planning your mobile application development and deployment.I cant help but think how much it costs to
    deploy a single application on a mobile platform.Let alone the same app on multiple mobile platforms.
