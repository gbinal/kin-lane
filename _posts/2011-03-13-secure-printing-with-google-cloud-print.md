{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive been doing a lot of work with the Google Cloud Print API lately.Ive built a prototype Google Cloud Print Proxy, and I am trying to push the boundaries of what can be done with Google Cloud Print.Im engineering cloud print solutions for commercial printing, and along the way Im also doing a lot of research around device printing.When it comes to device printing I keep seeing a concept called follow me printing or pull printing.Where you can queue up a print job from your computer, and then go to printer and print from the device.</p>
