    I spend a lot of time evaluating events and conferences.If Im going to an event I deeply want to understand the event and how it speaks to me.From an industry perspective I am evaluating events
    for their approach and how they are managing it.Either way I want a programmatic approach to digesting the events information.in its entirety.
