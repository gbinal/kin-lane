     I spend a lot of time evaluating events and conferences. If I'm going to an event I deeply want to understand the event and how it speaks to me. From an industry perspective I am evaluating events for their approach and how they are managing it. Either way I want a programmatic approach to digesting the events information...in its entirety. I want to see:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Event Overview
     </li>
     <li>Sessions
     </li>
     <li>Exhibitors
     </li>
     <li>Speakers
     </li>
     <li>Keynotes
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Of course this derived from my selfish desire to evaluate many sites with less effort. However I think it would help event managers syndicate their sites, contents and ultimately increase exposure. It would encourage developers to create event clients for browsing events during and after it happens. It would create more up to date directories of events in real-time. Just some random thoughts as I'm organizing them.
