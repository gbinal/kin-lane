I was playing around with the Paypal Storefront Widgets today and getting my head wrapped around what they offer.  They are a flashed based widget that are pretty slick.You can manage your storefront look and theme and all the details about your products.  You can change your settings on whether your storefront is open or closed as well as manage yourproduct inventory and how many are available for saPublish Postle.It got me thinking about how the storefront is continuing its migration from the home web site.  It has the potential to exist beyond the affiliate storefront as well.You can publish your products and allow people to purchase individual or multiple products anywhere.Lots of potential here.
