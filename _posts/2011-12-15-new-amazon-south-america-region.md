Amazon Web Services just announced a new South American Region located in Sao Paulo, Brazil. South America-based businesses and global companies with customers in South America can run their applications and workloads in the new Sao Paulo Region, significantly reducing latency to end-users in South America and allows those needing their data to reside in Brazil for legal reasons, to easily do so.
The new Sao Paulo Region is launched with a complete set of Amazon Web Services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, and Amazon CloudWatch.

That is seven regions that AWS is operating in now:

	US West - Northern California
	US West - Oregon
	US East - Virginia
	EU - Ireland
	Asia Pacific - Singapore
	Asia Pacific - Tokyo
	South America - Sao Paulo

It is eight regions if you count their Government cloud they have in Oregon. Amazon sure has come a long ways to become a truly global cloud computing provider. All they need is an Africa and Middle Eastern presence and they'll have the world wired.
