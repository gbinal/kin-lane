    Amazon Web Services just announced a new South American Region located in Sao Paulo, Brazil.South America-based businesses and global companies with customers in South America can run their
    applications and workloads in the new Sao Paulo Region, significantly reducing latency to end-users in South America and allows those needing their data to reside in Brazil for legal reasons, to
    easily do so.The new Sao Paulo Region is launched with a complete set of Amazon Web Services, including: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3),
    Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
    SNS), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Auto Scaling, AWS CloudFormation, and Amazon CloudWatch.That is seven regions that AWS is
    operating in now: US West - Northern California US West - Oregon US East - Virginia EU - Ireland Asia Pacific - Singapore Asia Pacific - Tokyo South America - Sao Paulo It is eight regions if you
    count their Government cloud they have in Oregon.Amazon sure has come a long ways to become a truly global cloud computing provider.
