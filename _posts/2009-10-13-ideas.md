I really like ideas. I have them all the time. I work all the time to organize, prioritize, share and collaborate on my ideas.[<img title="Idea-Management" src="http://kin_lane.s3.amazonaws.com/ideas.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="166" align="right" />][1]

I love hearing other people's ideas on things.

I was just browsing around the [wordpress][1] web site and came across their [idea section][1]. I really like this. I think every company should have an idea section where employees, customers, and partners can come and share their ideas on anything.

Idea management is a healthy personal and business activity, it should be encouraged.
