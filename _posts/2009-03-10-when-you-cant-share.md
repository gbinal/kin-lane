    It really bums me out when I can't share a news article I am reading. I read a lot of blogs and news throughout the day. I have finally gotten in the habit of sharing news via facebook or my
    twitter profile because of well placed sharing icons. However it frustrates me when I read a great piece of news and look to share...and I can't. Hard to believe any news outlet would not be on
    board with social sharing.
