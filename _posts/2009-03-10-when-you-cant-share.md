    It really bums me out when I cant share a news article I am reading.I read a lot of blogs and news throughout the day.I have finally gotten in the habit of sharing news via facebook or my twitter
    profile because of well placed sharing icons.However it frustrates me when I read a great piece of news and look to share.and I cant.
