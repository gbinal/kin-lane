    I came across this picture of the undersea cables running around the world.I thought it was real interesting to see how our Internet flows around the world.I recently read an article about how
    some rock slides here on the Oregon coast had caused an Internet outage in Australia.Knowing where these fiber lines run really helps you understand the fragility of our Internet community
