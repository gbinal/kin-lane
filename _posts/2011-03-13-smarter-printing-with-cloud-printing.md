I was attracted to my current job as the Mimeo Connect API evangelist because of the challenges associated with a print API.
You have a collision of a dying industry and a game changing new technology.    I thought...this has to be a learning experience.   So I pursued the job.
First thing I learned:  Print isn't dead. Its evolving, and the largest beasts in this industry (newspapers, magazines, book publishers) are too big to adjust, and they start wailing as they die.
Print is far from dead.  It is still a big part of daily business operations around the world.  Technology like mobile phones and social networks are evolving print.
Its not about print dying or going away, its about smarter printing.
