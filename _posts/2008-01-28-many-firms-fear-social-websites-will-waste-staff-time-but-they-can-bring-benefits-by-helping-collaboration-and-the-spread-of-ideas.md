    Great article in the Sunday Times Online called Learn to love social network sites, it is about the widespread perspective of social networks and how allowing them to be used at work will
    contribute to employees wasting time and losing money for companies.It talks about how many companies have banned social networks all together for their workers, and how this can back-fire for
    many companies.It moves into talking about what benefit allowing employees to use social networks can bring for both internal and external operations.They even start diving a little into some
    Wikinomics and talk about crowdsourcing and other 2.0 concepts.
