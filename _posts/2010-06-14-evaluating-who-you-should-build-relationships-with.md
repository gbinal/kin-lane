    Back when I ran my social media marketing company in 2008 I would help clients understand what blogs were important in their industry, and which blogs they should be working to build a
    relationship with.We used all types of tools and metrics for making this decision from Alexa ranking, number of comments on site to just a gut feeling.I was playing with Postrank tonight.My girl
    Audrey uses it at her job with RWW to determine valuable information sources.I came across their Domain Activity API.
