    I am not an expert in writing documentation for application program interfaces (API).I do play one on TV though.No not really, I read enough of them so I feel like Im an expert.I have written a
    couple of API SDK documentation packages and by no means were perfect.However I have been struggling with a set of API docs for a housing management integration for conferences, and the
    documentation really confused me.
