{% include JB/setup %}<p>Our teams have been working on some meeting and event planning systems lately that are deployed for multiple global events spanning many time zones.So having quality time zone information and meeting scheduling accuracy is very important.I have researched and came across several interesting links:

	Time Zone Event Planner - Compare Multiple Time Zones
	World Time Engine API
	The tz database

I ended up purchasing the World Time Zone Database Subscription because it provided the best set of data.Except when I purchased I expected a confirmation email or something.I got nothing.</p>
