     I was spending time organizing my Google Contacts. Up until now they really didn't "require" any sort of organization. Then I was playing with Google Buzz and seeing how I can use as part of my communication and production platform. With an organized Google Contacts and logical groups, I could get very fine tuned in my Google Buzz targeting. They allow you to to quickly mark your buzz as private, then distribute to certain groups:

So how does this apply?
