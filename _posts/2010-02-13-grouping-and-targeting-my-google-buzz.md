    I was spending time organizing my Google Contacts.Up until now they really didnt require any sort of organization.Then I was playing with Google Buzz and seeing how I can use as part of my
    communication and production platform.With an organized Google Contacts and logical groups, I could get very fine tuned in my Google Buzz targeting.They allow you to to quickly mark your buzz as
    private, then distribute to certain groups: One thing I noticed though is very few people in my groups actually use Buzz.
