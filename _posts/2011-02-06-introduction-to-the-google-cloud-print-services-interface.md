{% include JB/setup %}<p>The Google Cloud Print services interface or Google Cloud Print API is where the whole cloud print thing starts getting cool.The Google Cloud Print service interfaces allow you to create a cloud print proxy that gives you a virtual cloud printer you can send jobs to.Im developing a PHP / MySQL proxy that enables me to register a virtual cloud printer with Google Cloud Print (GCP) registry.Once the printer is registered with the service, it can then receive jobs from and communicate status with Google Cloud Print.Google defines a Cloud Print Proxy as: A cloud print proxy can be a piece of software that runs on a computer connected to a non-cloud-aware printer, a small add-on hardware device that contains the proxy interface and connects to the printer, or firmware that is built in to printers of the future.</p>
