We are now offering custom Amazon EC2 Research and Development services. If you are in need of custom EC2 instance deployment, feel free to contact us.

Timothy Meredith and I will be pioneering several custom deployments for clients and figured we'd offer these services to all other interested parties.

Pretty much any type of EC2 deployment on the Linux platform is where we are focused. Some examples are:


  * Web Server
  * Database Server
  * Email Server
  * SPAM Filter
  * LDAP Server
  * Video Server
  * Image Server
  * Utility Processing (Image resizing, video manipulation, etc.)
We will be posting specific packages and installations as they become available. Feel free to email [kinlane@gmail.com][1] if you have a specific instance configuration in mind that you need.
