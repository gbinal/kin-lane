{% include JB/setup %}<p>Being the big data geek I am, Im pretty excited that Google has integrated BigQuery with Google Apps Script and Google Spreadsheets.This means you can take power of BigQuery for storing and querying of very large data sets and combine them using Google Apps Scripts with any of your Google Spreadsheets.With a simple query Google Apps Script you can embed and process a query that pulls counts, fields and other information you use in spreadsheet columns and data visualizations.You can upload VERY large sets of data like the M-Lab dataset in BigQuery which contains 240B rows!I think this is an excellent example of the power of cloud computing.</p>
