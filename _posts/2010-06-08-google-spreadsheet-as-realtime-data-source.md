    I was just talking with Google I/O events team about keeping events sessions up to date on the conference and event sessions page.Sessions change rapidly and updates are needed by multiple teams
    in real-time.Web-site(s), support personnel, marketing, etc all need updated information.There are multiple digital and human sources that need the updates.There are also multiple people
    potentially making updates to the data.
