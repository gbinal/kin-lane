{% include JB/setup %}<p>Every time I discuss syndicated content to other sites and platforms I get the question, well what about getting in trouble for duplicate content?This is a topic that has been over-hyped and discussed way to much.It is true if you just programatically build out multiple sites all with the same or similar content you will get dinged for this.The problem people have is they are too focused on what search engines are thinking and forgot about their #2 users.HUMANS.</p>
