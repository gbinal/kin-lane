{% include JB/setup %}<p>I use quite a few different Firefox Add-Ons.I use Amazon S3 Firefox Organizer, EC2 UI, Google Notebook, coCommnet, Shareaholic, just to name a few.My right click, tray and toolbar is just getting very crowded.It would be nice if someone logically built out a framework for these to display.I hope with Firefox 3.</p>
