{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working on my prototype for a Google cloud printer that runs on a server.To set the stage, I want to get cloud print jobs sent from Google Docs using the Google Cloud Print Services Interface.You can retrieve a print job from the Google Cloud Print Services interface using /fetch.All it takes to get a new job is making a call to the Google Cloud Print (GCP) API on a regular schedule.The problem with this method is that it isnt real-time, is it?</p>
