    For the last four months Ive been on a pretty wild ride trying to find a solution to delivering the Mimeo Connect Print API and its community.I looked at the three major API service providers,
    Mashery, Apigee, and 3Scale.I also took a look at a new player, Mashape.After four months, whats the plan?Im going to build my own API area.
