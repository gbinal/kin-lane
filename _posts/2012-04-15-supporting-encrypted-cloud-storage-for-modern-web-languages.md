    As more of our lives move online, into the clouds, encrypted backup and storage of not just our vital data, but our personal photos, files and streams is becoming critical--this responsibility to
    provide secure cloud storage and backup solutions is up to developers of the software, people use every day.IDrive is working to provide these solutions for developers by delivering two
    interfaces for developers to integrate encrypted storage into their applications: Command Line Utility - Develop highly scalable, reliable and fast applications to manage your storage on IDrive
    EVS.Best for desktop applications and also ideal for CRON jobs.REST APIs - An interface designed to allow developers to easily build web and mobile applications to manage storage on IDrive EVS.To
    help support our REST APIs users, IDrive has developed three new libraries supporting modern web languages: PHP Python Ruby Using these libraries, web and mobile applications developers can
    provide secure cloud storage and back-up, that works with the IDrive platform.
