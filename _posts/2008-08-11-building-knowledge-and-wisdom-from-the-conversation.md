    Knowledge and wisdom is the most important piece you can extract from any social media campaign.Not matter what type of strategy you implement, learning from the conversation is where you should
    focus and the rest will come with it.Any amount of information can be obtained from many different conversational sources throughout your campaign, the following areas are typical conversational
    information sources; Blogs, Forums, Question and Answer Sites, Video Sharing Sites, Image Sharing Sites, Audio Sharing Sites, Search Engines.All this information can be organized in many shapes
    and forms for you to access.The real question is how you analyze and evaluate this information for it to become knowledge and wisdom.
