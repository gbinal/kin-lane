    Iâ€™ve been getting more comments lately about my appearance, as my API evangelism penetrates the enterprise and government.Specifically regarding my beard.An executive at a leading API service
    provider reminded me the other day, that I will be the only one with a beard at the Gartner AADI event in November.My appearance for me is natural.When I look in the mirror and I see my beard and
    long hair it feels more like me than the properly groomed version.
