<img class="alignnone c1" title="Gist" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Gist.PNG" alt="" width="165" height="79" align="right" />I have successfully integrated [social CRM service][1] [Gist][1] into [my platform][2]. I have bee using it on a daily basis for about a month now.

[Gist][1] allows me to integrate my:

  * Personal Gmail account and Google Apps Gmail
  * Personal Google Contacts and Google Apps Contacts
  * Google Calendar
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * LinkedIn
[Gist][1] then gives me a robust, yet intuitive dashboard to manage people and companies I interact with on a daily basis.

I can set the importance of each contact and view social streams, blog posts, emails, and events for all my contacts.

[Gist][1] gives me all these great tools for managing my CRM as well as bringing in tons of social and other contact related data.

Only thing I don't like is that I really don't have a public facing job at the moment, so my contacts list is very stagnant. That is not really [Gist][1]s fault though.
