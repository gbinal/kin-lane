{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have successfully integrated social CRM service Gist into my platform.I have bee using it on a daily basis for about a month now.Gist allows me to integrate my:

	Personal Gmail account and Google Apps Gmail
	Personal Google Contacts and Google Apps Contacts
	Google Calendar
	Facebook
	Twitter
	LinkedIn

Gist then gives me a robust, yet intuitive dashboard to manage people and companies I interact with on a daily basis.I can set the importance of each contact and view social streams, blog posts, emails, and events for all my contacts.Gist gives me all these great tools for managing my CRM as well as bringing in tons of social and other contact related data.</p>
