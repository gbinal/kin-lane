I like using whiteboards to sketch out ideas. I love drawing elaborate graphs and visuals to try and convey my point.

I usually take pictures of my drawings so I have a digital copy, and I have even played with a few smartboards that record my drawings.

I came across a web 2.0 whiteboard created by GE today called I[magination Cubed][1]. It is pretty cool.

Just a well done simple application. You can draw your thoughts and play it back and email it to people as well.

Give it a [try][1].
