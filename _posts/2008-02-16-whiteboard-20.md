    I like using whiteboards to sketch out ideas. I love drawing elaborate graphs and visuals to try and convey my point.<br />
    <br />
    I usually take pictures of my drawings so I have a digital copy, and I have even played with a few smartboards that record my drawings.<br />
    <br />
    I came across a web 2.0 whiteboard created by GE today called I<a href="http://imagination3.com/">magination Cubed</a>. It is pretty cool.<br />
    <br />
    Just a well done simple application. You can draw your thoughts and play it back and email it to people as well.<br />
    <br />
    Give it a <a href="http://imagination3.com/">try</a>.
