    I like using whiteboards to sketch out ideas.I love drawing elaborate graphs and visuals to try and convey my point.I usually take pictures of my drawings so I have a digital copy, and I have
    even played with a few smartboards that record my drawings.I came across a web 2.0 whiteboard created by GE today called Imagination Cubed.
