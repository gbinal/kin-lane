<img class="alignnone c1" title="Cloud Operating System" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-operating-system.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />I thoroughly enjoy my career right now. It is exciting being part of where technology and computing is going right now. I'm a total cloud computing fanboy, I admit. I do try to keep it realistic and focused on how it influences business and IT operations.

Right now I can really see "cloud computing" or the "cloud operating system" really coming together. Last week [Rackspace released their core cloud computing stack and created the OpenStack][1], which is focused on two important elements of the cloud OS:

  * Compute
  * Storage
These are the essential building blocks for the entire cloud operating system. I see all the other elements coming together as well:
  * Virtual Desktops
  * Cloud Office Applications
  * Communications with Email, Chat, and VOIP
  * Music
  * Video / Media
  * Images / Pictures
  * Print
We just need to work on the delivery and interoperability. My laptop, Iphone, Blackberry, Android and IPad should all see the the same cloud operating system profile. Depending on the interface I will have different aspects of my operating system available to me.

I should be able to listen to my music, management my documents, and print at home or office regardless of what machine I'm on. Its my operating system in the clouds.
