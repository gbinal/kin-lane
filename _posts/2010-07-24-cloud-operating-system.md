    I thoroughly enjoy my career right now.It is exciting being part of where technology and computing is going right now.Im a total cloud computing fanboy, I admit.I do try to keep it realistic and
    focused on how it influences business and IT operations.Right now I can really see cloud computing or the cloud operating system really coming together.
