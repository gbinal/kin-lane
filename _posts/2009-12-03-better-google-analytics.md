I have been playing with a new tool that gives you more control over your Google Analytics called [Trakkboard][1]. Google Analytics gives you a lot of tools, probably more than you really ever use.

However I am always looking for new takes on how to access and absorb all of the data they give you. [Trakkboard][1] gives you the opportunity to:

  * compare data from several Google Analytics accounts with each other.
  * follow current developments from your desktop.
  * summarize the most important [key performance indicators][2] on just one dashboard.
I will give more data as I play with. I was hoping to get more "dashboard" style tools to be able to give executives and managers access to overview data. We'll see how it goes.
