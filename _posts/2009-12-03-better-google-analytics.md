{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been playing with a new tool that gives you more control over your Google Analytics called Trakkboard. Google Analytics gives you a lot of tools, probably more than you really ever use.
However I am always looking for new takes on how to access and absorb all of the data they give you. Trakkboard gives you the opportunity to:

	compare data from several Google Analytics accounts with each other.
	follow current developments from your desktop.
	summarize the most important key performance indicators on just one dashboard.

I will give more data as I play with. I was hoping to get more "dashboard" style tools to be able to give executives and managers access to overview data. We'll see how it goes.
