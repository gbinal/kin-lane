    I’m spending more time building, what I’ve dubbed the&nbsp;CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social Stack, a list of APIs, platforms and tools that you can use in your local-mobile applications.&nbsp;With
    the latest move by&nbsp;Foursquare to join the OpenStreetMaps&nbsp;movement, I’m focused on finding the best mapping tools for the CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social Stack.First on my list of
    alternative mapping solutions is&nbsp;Verizon Mapkit API, which provides location-based services that include maps, search, traffic and static directions.&nbsp;The Verizon Mapkit API is centered
    on a map object that provides a tile-based solution supporting multiple layers such road map/satellite/hybrid, traffic, and routes--with built-in controls for standard map operations such as
    panning and zooming using the host device’s native gestures.The MapKit also provides a full set of search APIs delivering geocoding, geolocation and access to local content: Address Search
    (Geocoding) Reverse Geocoding Local Search Fuel Price Search Movie Theaters Movie Show-Times Events Event Venues Traffic Incidents Static Directions The Verizon Mapkit API does not have a web API
    currently, but does&nbsp;support native application development on Android, iOS, Blackberry and Brew MP platforms.
