{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been doing a lot of work with Google Cloud Print lately.It is an amazing platfor, however one complaint I have is that it currently supports printing only through iPhone, IPad and Android devices.So I started looking and I found a Google Chrome extension that will let you print documents from your regular desktop or laptop browser.Using the extension, you will see an icon in your address bar when you are vewing a PDF or Word document in a Google Chrome browser.You can click the icon and print the document using the cloud printers you have registered with your Google Cloud Print service.</p>
