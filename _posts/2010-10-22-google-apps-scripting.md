Google introduced [scripting for Google Sites][1] today. [Google Apps Script][2] uses JavaScript to allow automation across Google products and interaction with 3rd party services.

Google Apps Scripts allow you to:

  * Automate repetitive business processes
  * Integrate 3rd party services within Google Apps
  * Create custom spreadsheet functions
  * Build and collect user inputs

In addition to accessing Google Products they provide many tools for working with UI, SOAP, XML and other helpful utilities.

Google Sites moves beyond a simple wiki with the addition of Google Apps Scripting. It now is more of an application platform allowing integration with other Google products and 3rd party services.
