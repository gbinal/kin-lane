     I am looking around my Google Account Ecosystem and playing. Since the addition of Google Buzz I spend more time looking at my profile page. My buzzs' come up more in searches so I tend to stumble on my own profile page more. <img class="c1" title="Google Profile" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/GoogleProfile.PNG" alt="" width="550" align="center" /> I have used iGoogle as my home page since...I can't remember. Its been years. I have various widgets and tools exposed on my iGoogle. <img class="c1" title="Google Profile" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/iGoogle.PNG" alt="" width="550" align="center" /> iGoogle is my home page for quick access to Google Search and a handful of other tools, primarily I use:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Gmail
     </li>
     <li>Google Reader
     </li>
     <li>Google Calendar
     </li>
     <li>Google Wave
     </li>
     <li>Weather
     </li>
     <li>Google Tasks
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I have a bunch of other ones, but rarely use them. I really see Google Profile increasingly become a very public profile of myself, and my iGoogle has long been my private personal and business dashboard to the Internet. Stay tuned as I play with other combination of Google products to see what I can come up with.
