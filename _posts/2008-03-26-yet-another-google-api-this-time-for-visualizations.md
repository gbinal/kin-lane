The [Google Visualization API][1] lets you access multiple sources of structured data that you can display, choosing from a large selection of visualizations.

The [Google Visualization API][1] also provides a platform that can be used to create, share and reuse visualizations written by the developer community.

You can embed visualizations directly into your website and display attractive data on your website by choosing from visualizations created by the developer community.

The Google Visualization API provides simple Gadget extensions to its API to create visualization Gadgets. Publish these here or in the Gadget directory. Become an active participant in the developer community; reuse and share visualizations with others.

Create extensions to Google products: Write visualization applications for Google products such as Google Docs. With a growing list of products that support Gadgets, syndicate your app.

You can use many data sources with one API. A visualization apps created using the API are able to access any compliant data source with no required code changes to your application. Developers can start building apps immediately using Google Spreadsheets as a supported data source.

Here are a few examples of the visualizations that are created in the [Google Visualization API Gadget Gallery][2]:
