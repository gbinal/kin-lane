It is a damn sexy flash tool for building widgets. It is to do and obviously targeting the non programmer wishing to deploy and syndicate their content and brand.

It is a nice drag and drop interface and you can create, deploy, and track all the widgets you deploy.

These tools are really going to come into play in 2008 when the average business starts integrating widget syndication into their social media marketing strategies.

I am going to build a couple of them tonight and see what I can create.

I will post some more once I get one deployed.
