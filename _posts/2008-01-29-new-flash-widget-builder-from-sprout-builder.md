    I was just playing around with the new widget builder from Sprout Builder, I found it over on Techcrunch - Sprout: The Online WYSIWYG Editor for Flash.It is a damn sexy flash tool for building
    widgets.It is to do and obviously targeting the non programmer wishing to deploy and syndicate their content and brand.It is a nice drag and drop interface and you can create, deploy, and track
    all the widgets you deploy.These tools are really going to come into play in 2008 when the average business starts integrating widget syndication into their social media marketing strategies.
