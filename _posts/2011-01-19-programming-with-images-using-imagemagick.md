<p>
     ImageMagick is open source Apache 2.0 project that allows you to programmaticaly create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in over 100 formats: GIF JPEG PDF PNG TIFF ImageMagick can scale, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines and shapes ImageMagick is a command line utility which you can choose from several libraries: JMagick for Java MagickNet for .NET MagickWand for PHP IMagick for PHP PythonMagick for Python RMagick for Ruby I spent about an hour looking a wide variety of commercial image manipulation applications before I stumbled across ImageMagick. I've seen it before, but don't remember it being so functional. Its great to see such innovative and powerful open-source projects in a sea of spammy and commercial software offerings.
