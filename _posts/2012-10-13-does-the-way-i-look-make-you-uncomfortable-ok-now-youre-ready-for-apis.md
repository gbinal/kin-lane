<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting more comments lately about my appearance, as my API evangelism penetrates the enterprise and government.  Specifically regarding my beard.</p>
<p>An executive at a leading API service provider reminded me the other day, that I will be the only one with a beard at the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/applications/">Gartner AADI</a> event in November.</p>
<p>My appearance for me is natural.   When I look in the mirror and I see my beard and long hair it feels more like me than the properly groomed version.  It  is also deliberate.  I know it makes some people feel a little uncomfortable--but that is something you will need to accept.</p>
<p>As I see it, to play in this new world of web APIs you have to be able to accept being out of your comfort zone.  APIs are about giving up a little control, in order to let in new ideas and innvoation.</p>

<p>As you can see in the before (2010) and after (2012) photo, back when I was VP of Technology at <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com/">WebEvents Global</a> and running SAP and Google events I played the game, but now as API Evangelist--not so much.</p>
<p>If my new look makes you a little uncomfortable, that is a good thing.  It&rsquo;s just a little taste of what it will take for you to leave your comfort zone and successful open up your companies assets and resources via APIs.</p>
<p>My goal isn&rsquo;t to offend anyone, but make you think a little bit about what you are getting into.  I hope you can quickly get past my appearance, hear what I have to say about APIs.  I definitely have a lot more to say than I did in 2010 when I looked &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, and I think once you listen to my evangelism for a little while--I&rsquo;ll win you over.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I think you will at least remember me. &nbsp;</p>
