    I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across a really cool service. It is something I've thought of doing a couple of times. It is a way to <a href=
    "https://www.watchdox.com/">send documents securely</a>, and control and track who views, prints or forwards them. It is called <a href="https://www.watchdox.com/">WatchDox</a>. Something clients
    and people I work with often ask for. And this is built upon the Amazon Cloud Infrastructure so you k now it will scale and be at a very low price point (hopefully). I haven't taken for a full
    test drive yet. I will take a test drive and see how it works, later.
