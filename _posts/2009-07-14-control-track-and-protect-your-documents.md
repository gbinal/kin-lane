    I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across a really cool service.It is something Ive thought of doing a couple of times.It is a way to send documents securely,
    and control and track who views, prints or forwards them.It is called WatchDox.Something clients and people I work with often ask for.
