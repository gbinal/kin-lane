{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across a really cool service. It is something I've thought of doing a couple of times.
It is a way to send documents securely, and control and track who views, prints or forwards them. It is called WatchDox.
Something clients and people I work with often ask for. And this is built upon the Amazon Cloud Infrastructure so you k now it will scale and be at a very low price point (hopefully). I haven't taken for a full test drive yet.
I will take a test drive and see how it works, later.
