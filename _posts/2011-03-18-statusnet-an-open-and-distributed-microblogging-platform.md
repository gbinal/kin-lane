Think of it as your own private Twitter service.

StatusNet offers similar functionality to Twitter, but allows business and individuals to control their own services and data, while still inter-operating with existing microblogging platformslike Twitter and Facebook.

[StatusNet is open source][2], and provides [APIs for custom integration][3].

The platform provides a [directory of themes, plugins, and applications][4] built on StatusNet.

[Identi.ca][5], a popular microblogging service runs on the StatusNet platform.

I consider platforms like StatusNet very important for the future of the Internet. They offer open, standards based solutions to communication and collaboration while still inter-operating with other major platforms.
