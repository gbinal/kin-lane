I was just playing around with Deki Wiki a free open source wiki and application platform for deploying enterprise scale applications.I was blown away with the functionality of this.  It has all the great Wiki characteristics, however it goes a step further and truly is an application deployment platform.It shares some common characteristics with my Original Web Solutions Network Platform.  They embraced a web services architecture just like I did as well as utilize Amazon S3 for core storage needs.They built the business layer using PHP and the Web Services data layer using Microsoft C#.   It can be deployed on a Windows or Linux platform.It is truly a sweet application and I hope to get the chance to deploy one soon.
