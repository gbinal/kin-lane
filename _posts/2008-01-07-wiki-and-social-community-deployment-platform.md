{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just playing around with Deki Wiki a free open source wiki and application platform for deploying enterprise scale applications.I was blown away with the functionality of this.It has all the great Wiki characteristics, however it goes a step further and truly is an application deployment platform.It shares some common characteristics with my Original Web Solutions Network Platform.They embraced a web services architecture just like I did as well as utilize Amazon S3 for core storage needs.</p>
