<img class="c1" title="HTML5 Rocks" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/HTML5/HTML5-Rocks.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google is evangelizing HTML5 big time. It is obvious that they are behind HTML5 since their Google Chrome is the furthest along in HTML 5 support. Today they launched a new [HTML 5 resource site][1] called [HTML5Rocks][2]!

They are launching the site with nine HTML5 tutorials:

  * [Introduction to Chrome Developer Tools, Part One][3]
  * [Best Practices for a Faster Web App with HTML5][4]
  * [A Beginner's Guide to Using the Application Cache][5]
  * [Practical Guide to Take Your TODO List Offline][6]
  * [Reading local files in JavaScript][7]
  * [A Simple Trip Meter using the Geolocation API][8]
  * [Using the Notifications API][9]
  * [A Simple TODO list using HTML5 WebDatabases][10]
  * [Quick Guide to Implementing the HTML5 Audio Tag][11]
In addition to the tutorials, they give you an [HTML 5 code playground][12] for playing with code in real-time and seeing how the browser reacts.

The site is a great start, complete with an [HTML 5 reference library][13]. They are looking for feedback on what developers would like to see next.

Some great tools for [learning HTML 5][14].
