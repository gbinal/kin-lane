Amazon just launched a new analysis tool for Amazon S3 called, S3Stat. This tool uses the log files generated by S3, analyzes them using [Webalizer][1], and generates a variety of reports. Take a look at the [sample reports][2] to learn more. There's a one-month free trial and usage after that costs just $2 per month. Take a look at the [pricing plan][3] to learn more. While you are on the site you may want to take a look at their list of [S3 resources][4] as well.
