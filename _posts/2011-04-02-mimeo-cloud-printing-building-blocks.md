In preparation of my new Mimeo Connect API area I am assembling what I consider to be the core building blocks of cloud printing.
My goal is to create projects that focus on key documents, platforms, and technologies of cloud printing. I am breaking them into several areas.
<strong>Cloud Printing Technologies</strong><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/legos.jpg"  width="200" align="right" />
<ul>
     <li>Mimeo Connect REST Cloud Print API
     </li>
     <li>Google Cloud Print
     </li>
     <li>HP ePrint
     </li>
     <li>Apple Airprint
     </li>
</ul><strong>Cloud Storage and Document Platforms</strong>
<ul>
     <li>Box.net
     </li>
     <li>Amazon S3
     </li>
     <li>Dropbox
     </li>
     <li>Scribd
     </li>
     <li>Google Docs
     </li>
</ul><strong>Document Types and Print Formats</strong><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo_connect_logo.jpg"  width="200" align="right" />
<ul>
     <li>Brochures / Flyers
     </li>
     <li>BoundDocuments
     </li>
     <li>Binders
     </li>
     <li>Posters
     </li>
     <li>Photo Books
     </li>
</ul>I consider these my initial building blocks for the next generation of printing.
With these building blocks you can assemble just about any print document, from top platforms, from any desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.
Once I have my API area up and running, you will find me at conferences and meetups talking with developers about what is possible.
