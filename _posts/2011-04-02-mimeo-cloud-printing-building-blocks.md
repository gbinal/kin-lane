    platforms, and technologies of cloud printing.I am breaking them into several areas.Cloud Printing Technologies Mimeo Connect REST Cloud Print API Google Cloud Print HP ePrint Apple Airprint
    Cloud Storage and Document Platforms Box.net Amazon S3 Dropbox Scribd Google Docs Document Types and Print Formats Brochures / Flyers BoundDocuments Binders Posters Photo Books I consider these
    my initial building blocks for the next generation of printing.
