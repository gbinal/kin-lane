{% include JB/setup %}In preparation of my new Mimeo Connect API area I am assembling what I consider to be the core building blocks of cloud printing.
My goal is to create projects that focus on key documents, platforms, and technologies of cloud printing. I am breaking them into several areas.
Cloud Printing Technologies

	Mimeo Connect REST Cloud Print API
	Google Cloud Print
	HP ePrint
	Apple Airprint

Cloud Storage and Document Platforms

	Box.net
	Amazon S3
	Dropbox
	Scribd
	Google Docs

Document Types and Print Formats

	Brochures / Flyers
	BoundDocuments
	Binders
	Posters
	Photo Books

I consider these my initial building blocks for the next generation of printing.
With these building blocks you can assemble just about any print document, from top platforms, from any desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.
Once I have my API area up and running, you will find me at conferences and meetups talking with developers about what is possible.
