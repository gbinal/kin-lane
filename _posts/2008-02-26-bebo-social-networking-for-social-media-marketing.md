    Been doing some work on various Bebo Social Network Profiles as part of a social media marketing campaign.Since I am spending some time here I thought I would share some thoughts and
    strategy.First off Bebo is a very European focused social network.There are a lot of US users, but definitely heavy on the European market.I got setup and have my profile all filled out from my
    social media profile content platform.
