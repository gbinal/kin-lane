    I am really blown away by some of the opportunities for cloud computing growth and adoption within the federal goverment right now.With all the recovery money out there, there is a lot of of
    projects that just need a little cloud perspective.I am seeing multiple database, server infrastructure, networking and application projects at the federal and state levels that just need some
    cloud savvy providers to come in and snatch up.Hopefully a lot of this recovery money we are spending can help fuel the growth and adoption of cloud computing.
