{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im closely following the whole Instagram terms of service discussion.I will be watching closely and if Instagram follows through with implementing these TOS changes, I will migrate my photos and close my account.As with other discussions around the viability of depending upon cloud platforms and building apps and businesses on top of APIs--I am always amazed at how many folks defend this behavior.Whether its Instagram changing their terms of use in favor of its advertising strategy or Twitter shutting off access to developers in favor of its own monetization strategy--they are just short-sighted, unimaginative attempts to make money and meet the demand their investors.What I find interesting, is how many people step up to defend Instagram or Twitter in these online battles.</p>
