{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been using my company outlook for the day because for some reason my left hand menu in Gmail (Apps for my Domain) takes up 3/4 of the screen?I cant figure out why, anyways it gives me a headache.So I switched to use my Outlook which I maintain because so many people in the company use it.Although I have been clean and sober from Outlook since 2006.One thing that immediately frustrated me is the lack of threaded conversations.</p>
