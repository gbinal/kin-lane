<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-cloud-print/google-mobile-cloud-print.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I was working on a demo today on[Google Cloud Printing][1] from [Google Apps][2]. I wanted to go through the process of adding a [Mimeo][3] Google Cloud Printer to my Google Account, then be able to show on my [IPhone][4] or [IPad][5].

Displaying IPad or IPhone becomes more difficult in a presentation let alone a virtual presentation.

So I set out looking for an IPhone emulator which I could show [Google Docs][6] on. They all work pretty weel, I just couldn't get Google Docs to show properly.

Then I had an idea. I downloaded [User Agent Switcher][7], a Firefox Add-On. User Agent Switcher allows me to change my browser's user agent to whatever I want.

I installed, restarted the browser, went to tools and changed my default user agent to IPhone 3.0.

I refreshed my Google Docs page and when it reloaded I was viewing my Google Docs account using the mobile interface in my Firefox browser on my Macbook Pro.

It was a quick and dirty way to be able to use Google Cloud Print in Google Apps from my Laptop, and since I don't use Firefox much I can leave Google Apps open and use my Google Cloud Print on my Macbook.
