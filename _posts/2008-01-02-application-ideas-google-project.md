{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have this notebook of application ideas that I have from time to time.  Its overflowing with lots of stupid ideas. So I am just going to start posting them here and see if someone has done something like it out there or maybe someone will get motivated and do it for me.Most ideas I have if I perform a little due diligence, I can find someone who is doing something similar.  However some I think are unique.Here we go:  I would like a Google Project Tracking solution to bring all my users, email, tasks, blogs, videos, docs, notebooks, events, and all my other stuff under one umbrella on the Google Platform.  It would work nicely with Remember the Milk task system.</p>
