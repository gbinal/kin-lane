{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have this notebook of application ideas that I have from time to time.Its overflowing with lots of stupid ideas.So I am just going to start posting them here and see if someone has done something like it out there or maybe someone will get motivated and do it for me.Most ideas I have if I perform a little due diligence, I can find someone who is doing something similar.However some I think are unique.</p>
