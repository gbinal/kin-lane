{% include JB/setup %}<p>So I signed up for a system I really think is going to become a big part of my daily life.It is a voice to text voice mail system called Jott.It is one of the best ideas and well built systems I have seen in a while.The core of the system is I can call a number and say a word that references a name or link and then talk for 30 seconds and it translates the voice mail to text and registers it as a jott in the system.Then based upon the word reference that I say it will email the text and a audio file link to the name of the person I say.</p>
