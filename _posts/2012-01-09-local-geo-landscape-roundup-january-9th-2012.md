If one of your resolutions is to be greener this year, you can start by using the AMEE Location Foot printer(ALF) to track your environmental footprint based on your foursquare check-in data. ALF looks at the distance between the places you check in to throughout the week, makes a best guess at what mode of transportation you used (plane, car, or walking), and then calculates your CO2 emissions.

Well, you do not have to imagine anymore, the Facebook Graph API now supports HTTP ETags. ETags support on the Facebook Platform can help you reduce bandwidth consumption and client-side overhead by suppressing output when making Graph API calls. In addition, clients (especially mobile devices on slow connections) can increase performance and reduce data usage when calling the Graph API with ETags.

For app developers, these offers can be a valuable additional source of revenue by helping them monetize users that may not otherwise pay for virtual currency. Today were launching in-app currency offers, which lets developers award users with their own in-app currency (e. g. , Fred Currency in Fred's game) upon completing an offer. Previously, developers were able to integrate Credits offers, where users earned Facebook Credits by completing offers. The new in-app currency offers product is in addition to the Credits offers product, and you can utilize either or both in your app.
