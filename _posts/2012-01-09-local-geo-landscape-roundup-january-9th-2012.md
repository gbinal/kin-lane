          <strong><a href="http://working.laneworks.net/gather/">Platform Updates: Operation Developer Love</a></strong>- (12-28-2011) - Last week we announced Mobile Hacks in New York and Boston and outlined new features we are making available to games developers. With the worldwide rollout of Facebook Timeline underway, we are beginning to the process of reviewing Open Graph actions submitted for approval. We expect to start approving actions in January and will post an update once we begin to approve actions in earnest. Once the action is approved, the person who submitted the action for approval will receive a Facebook notification and the app can begin publishing this action to all users.
