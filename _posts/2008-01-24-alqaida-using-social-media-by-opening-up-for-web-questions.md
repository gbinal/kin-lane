     I was just listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18337970">NPR story about how senior Al-Qaida</a> press department has asked supporters to submit questions on a message boards.
     <br />
     <br />
     Supposively they are to be answered by Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.
     <br />
     <br />
     Many jihadist and terrorists posted questions about he organization and what they should do?
     <br />
     <br />
     Seems everyone is seeing value in social media.
