I was just listening to an [NPR story about how senior Al-Qaida][1] press department has asked supporters to submit questions on a message boards.

Supposively they are to be answered by Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Many jihadist and terrorists posted questions about he organization and what they should do?

Seems everyone is seeing value in social media.
