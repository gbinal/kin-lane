    Amazon released a summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS service disruption in the US East Region today.These so caled stuck volumes and stuck EC2 instances, well those were mine.Right after
    midnight on April 21st I was working on one of my harvest tools, which pulls feeds from all major blogs, breaks them down and stores them for analysis.I was reviewing the analysis for what it
    pulled in the last hour, then my EC2 instance froze.I closed everything down and logged back into the root, but it took be about 45 minutes to actually get things to load back up.
