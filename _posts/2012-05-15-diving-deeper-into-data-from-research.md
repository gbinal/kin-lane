I was reading a report commissioned by Google and conducted by Ipsos MediaCT in partnership with the Mobile Marketing Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, called [Our Mobile Planet][1].

You can find the report at [OurMobilePlanet.com][1]. Included with the report on the mobile consumer, the site provides access to the full set of data from the research through a chart creation tool or the direct download of full country level data files.

The report is very informative, but the real story is how the report is published. It is a complete site, report, reporting tools and full access to the data. This is nothing new. Its something [The Guardian][2] does well in the context of data-driven journalism.

When it comes to research I think it should become the standard. If you create a report, you should have to not only publish the report, you should provide interactive tools allowing non-developers to derive their own visualizations as well as raw data access for those who really want to dive deeper.

I think many companies who commission research are fine with just publishing the final results. I feel pretty strongly that the next generation of research **MUST** have data visualization tools bundled with the report, as well as access to raw data so others can validate findings or take it in a potentially new direction.
