    I was reading a report commissioned by Google and conducted by Ipsos MediaCT in partnership with the Mobile Marketing Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, called Our Mobile
    Planet.You can find the report at OurMobilePlanet.com.Included with the report on the mobile consumer, the site provides access to the full set of data from the research through a chart creation
    tool or the direct download of full country level data files.The report is very informative, but the real story is how the report is published.
