    I had two ideas for stories that some day I would like to write.I generally start a new Google Doc and flush out the beginning of story or production that I would like to flush out more and
    eventually do something with.My products can range from blog posts to actual books I want to write.Who knows if Ill ever do anything with them, but I like recording them.I have ideas, thoughts
    and stories in my Google Docs going back a couple years from now.
