{% include JB/setup %}<p>Was just reading the post on Wired about the Australian broadband initiatiave.Makes me wish our government would really get on the ball with this issue.Fiber to the door of every americans home should be a high priority.Its an issue that is long over due.Of course you can reach every home, but high quality broadband should be available everywhere.</p>
