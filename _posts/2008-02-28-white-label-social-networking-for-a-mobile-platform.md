It is called iamota impact. It allows you to:Quickly and easily create and launch mobile services.Add mobile "Opt-ins" to many types of media: Web, blogs, email, social networks, TV, print, billboards, bus boards, on-product, radio, POS, live events And it gives you:Single interface to power mobile marketing, messaging, social networking, location-based services, content delivery and payment Handles all wireless carrier certifications, device-specific content optimizations, digital rights management, carrier and Mobile Marketing Association rules Open API and custom mobile services Financial clearing and settlement Reporting and statistics It looks like the start of a pretty sweet service.  It is a little pricey, but as we see more competition in this space I think we'll see more FREE and low cost solutions.
