    I have been playing with Ning a lot lately and really pushing it to see its potential for a rapid social network deployment.It is very powerful and gives you a huge amount control over setting up
    a social network.Now I heard about a new white label social networking platform for mobile and handhelds.It is called iamota impact.It allows you to:Quickly and easily create and launch mobile
    services.
