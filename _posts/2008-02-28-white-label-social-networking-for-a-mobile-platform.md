     I have been playing with Ning a lot lately and really pushing it to see its potential for a rapid social network deployment.
     <br />
     <br />
     It is very powerful and gives you a huge amount control over setting up a social network.
     <br />
     <br />
     Now I heard about a new white label social networking platform for mobile and handhelds. It is called <a href="http://www.iamotaimpact.com/en/">iamota impact</a>.
     <br />
     <br />
     It allows you to:
     <br />
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Quickly and easily create and launch mobile services.
     </li>

     <li>Add mobile "Opt-ins" to many types of media: Web, blogs, email, social networks, TV, print, billboards, bus boards, on-product, radio, POS, live events
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     And it gives you:
     <br />
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Single interface to power mobile marketing, messaging, social networking, location-based services, content delivery and payment
     </li>

     <li>Handles all wireless carrier certifications, device-specific content optimizations, digital rights management, carrier and Mobile Marketing Association rules
     </li>

     <li>Open API and custom mobile services
     </li>

     <li>Financial clearing and settlement
     </li>

     <li>Reporting and statistics
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     It looks like the start of a pretty sweet service. It is a little pricey, but as we see more competition in this space I think we'll see more FREE and low cost solutions.
