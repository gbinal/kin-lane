    I have a serious problem with working too much.I have trouble sitting still and watching TV let alone something as simple as reading a book or playing a card game.I think somewhat started with
    being young and somewhat ADHD.I dont put the blame there, it lies with myself and my obsessive-compulsive personality and feeling a need to always have a business or startup and always striving
    to learn and be part of the latest trend.Now that Im 36 and had some big shifts in my life I am retraining myself.
