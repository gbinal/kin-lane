LinkedIn is just doing it the way it should be done. They fully embrace data portability as well as understand that they need to open their platform up via API's and taking part in OpenSocial.

They provide what average users need in data portability as well as privacy.

They also understand what us developers are looking for in a [business class social networking platform][1].

Check out their perspective by reading their latest blog post [Who Owns Your Data? (hint: you do)][2].
