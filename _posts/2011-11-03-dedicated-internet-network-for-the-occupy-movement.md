    As reported by Adrianne Jeffries of BetaBeat, the Free Network Foundation is building a private network for Occupy Wall Streetand its affiliated movements in other cities.So far the organization
    has deployed two prototype FreedomTowers providing Internet access at Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Austin.We are the Free Network Foundation, builders and advocates of distributed and
    decentralized communication systems.We believe that the Internet should be used to connect people, not to spy on them, oppress them, or turn a profit, says co-founder and executive director Isaac
    Wilder.In addition to providing Internet for the occupiers, the network provides local services as well has secure communications between occupy locations, preventing them from getting
    intercepted on the open Internet.
