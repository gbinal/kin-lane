<img class="alignnone c1" title="Programmable Web" src="http://blog.programmableweb.com/images/logo2.png" alt="" width="190" height="72" align="right" />I was just reading on the [Programmable Web][1] blog that they were acquired by [Alcatel-Lucent][2]. Not sure what this means for their content and direction.

I have always followed programmable web because they are the best place to discover new APIs. Hopefully they can stay objective and stay focused on the next generation of API development.
