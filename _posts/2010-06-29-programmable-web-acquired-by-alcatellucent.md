{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading on the Programmable Web blog that they were acquired by Alcatel-Lucent. Not sure what this means for their content and direction.
I have always followed programmable web because they are the best place to discover new APIs. Hopefully they can stay objective and stay focused on the next generation of API development.</p>
