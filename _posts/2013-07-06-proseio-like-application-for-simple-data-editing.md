If you haven't use [Prose.io][1], for editing of markup and markdown content in your Github repositories, I highly recommend it. Prose.io provides a dead simple editor for content, which works very will for managing static page or blog content stored in a Github repository, and made public using Github Pages.Â 

I use Prose.io to easily manage content across many projects I maintain. I like the concept of a dead simple editor that connects to Github using oAuth and assists me in managing repositories of information.

I would like to see a similar app, but instead of markup and markdown it is for simple management of data, allowing me to:

  * Import / Export Spreadsheet
  * Import / Export CSV
  * Import / Export TSV
  * Import / Export from Google Spreadsheet

This application could provide a simple visual table editor for working with smaller data sets, allowing users to get the data in, via a preferred format as well as export in a similiar desired format. Allowing editing in a common table format in between import and export.

Even though I have been working as a database administrator for over 20 years, I have found myself working with simple JSON, CSV data sets that are stored in repositories lately. Having a dead simple, web-based data editor would go along way in supporting the open data movement.

Dateditor.io is available, and would make a nice addition to my [Hacker Storytelling][2] toolbox. I wish I had more time, I would build myself, but I am happy to help support someone else running with as an open source tool.
