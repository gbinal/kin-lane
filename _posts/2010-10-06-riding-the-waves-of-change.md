    Change happens.With technology, change seems to be accelerating, or at least the waves of change seem to come more frequently.I feel Ive developed a certain rhythm for riding these waves.Part of
    this rhythm is a regular evaluation of where I stand, a sort of agile career methodology.Im in one of those evaluation periods right now.
