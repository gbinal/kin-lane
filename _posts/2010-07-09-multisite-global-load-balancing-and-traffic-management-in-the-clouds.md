{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reviewing the cloud tools offered by Zeus.I was researching Global server Load Balancing (Cloud Balancing) software yesterday and they were on my list.Unfortunately I used an image from their software and neglected to mention them in my post.I just spent the last couple hours reviewing their tools and 3 specific products stand out:

	Multi-Site Manager - Tools for managing applications that span multiple, geographically distributed, data-centers and cloud providers.Global Load Balancer - DNS solutions for managing traffic on geographic locations and data center performance and availability.</p>
