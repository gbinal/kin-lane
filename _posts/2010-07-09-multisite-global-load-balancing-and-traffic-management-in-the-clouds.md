    I was just reviewing the cloud tools offered by Zeus.I was researching Global server Load Balancing (Cloud Balancing) software yesterday and they were on my list.Unfortunately I used an image
    from their software and neglected to mention them in my post.I just spent the last couple hours reviewing their tools and 3 specific products stand out: Multi-Site Manager - Tools for managing
    applications that span multiple, geographically distributed, data-centers and cloud providers.Global Load Balancer - DNS solutions for managing traffic on geographic locations and data center
    performance and availability.
