I have been getting asked by friends for information on how to setup their own business. I think in these hard times getting a business going can be a very appealing alternative to finding another job.

While I was doing the research I figured I'd just publish here for everyone to reference.

This generally applies to starting a business in Oregon, because that is where I am located.

First go to the State of Oregon and fill out the [Assumed Business Name (ABN) new registration form][1].

I assume you will be just starting a business for yourself, nothing too complicated.

You can fill out online or print and mail in. It costs you $50.00 currently.

You should receive in the mail in a few days or if you do online it should be quicker. You will then have a **_State of Oregon Business Registry Number_**.

You will then take this State of Oregon Business Registry Number and go register for an **_[Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)][2]_**.

You can do this online or print and mail in as well. Then you will receive the equivalent of a Social Security Number for your business.

With an **_State of Oregon Business Registry Number_** and **_Employer Identification Number (EIN)_** you now have a basic business entity.

You can now go to the bank with both these forms / numbers and get a business bank account.

With a business entity and bank account you can now conduct business under your assumed business name. You can receive checks and other payments for business.

There are a lot of other things you can do now that you have a business. I recommend keeping track of your money with [Quickbooks Online][3] as your first step.

More to come later....
