Was just reading a cool post about [Flash Mobs on Ignite Media][1]. Very cool concept.

Is it social media?

Is it art?

Is it protest?

[Ignite Media][2] defines a flash mob as:


  1. You gather a group of people (through text messages, Facebook groups, emails, whatever) and ask them to come to a particular place at a particular time;
  2. You all do something for a short period;
  3. You simply disband and go about your business.
Here is the video they posted that gives a good example:
