A while back Google released a new reporting feature in their Google Checkout payment system, and now they have added an [Order Report API][1] for getting access to your Google Checkout orders.

They seem to be have found a nice flow to their feature rollout and extending it through the API shortly thereafter.

Nice example of how [Web Application Development][2] should occur.
