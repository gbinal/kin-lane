    <span class="byline-author">A while back Google released a new reporting feature in their Google Checkout payment system, and now they have added an <a href=
    "http://googlecheckout.blogspot.com/2008/01/announcing-order-report-api.html">Order Report API</a> for getting access to your Google Checkout orders.<br />
    <br />
    They seem to be have found a nice flow to their feature rollout and extending it through the API shortly thereafter.<br />
    <br /></span>Nice example of how <a href="http://www.originalwebsolutions.com">Web Application Development</a> should occur.
