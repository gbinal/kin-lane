{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been answering a lot of questions on LinkedIn and Quora lately about where the best place to store data in the clouds.There are a lot of answers to this question.Cloud storage comes in many shapes, sizes, and prices.Business class, personal usage, storage APIs and much more.I store my:

	Amazon EC2 machine images in Amazon S3
	Server data, logs and files in Amazon  S3
	Personal workstation back ups in Amazon  S3
	Images on Picasa, Flickr, and Zip up originals and upload to Amazon  S3
	Documents (Word, PDF, Spreadsheets) in Google Docs (FREE and Google App)

I overwhelmingly use Amazon S3.</p>
