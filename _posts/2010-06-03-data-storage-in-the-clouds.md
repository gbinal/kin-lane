I have been answering a lot of questions on [LinkedIn][1] and [Quora][2] lately about where the best place to store data in the clouds. There are a lot of answers to this question.

Cloud storage comes in many shapes, sizes, and prices. Business class, personal usage, storage APIs and much more.

I store my:

  * [Amazon EC2][3] machine images in [Amazon S3][4]
  * Server data, logs and files in [Amazon S3][4]
  * Personal workstation back ups in [Amazon S3][4]
  * Images on [Picasa][5], [Flickr][6], and Zip up originals and upload to [Amazon S3][4]
  * Documents (Word, PDF, Spreadsheets) in Google Docs (FREE and Google App)
I overwhelmingly use Amazon S3. I get my data there using 3 different methods:
  * [Jungle Disk][7] Backups and Mapped Network Drives
  * Firefox [S3 Fox][8] Add-On
  * [Cross FTP Client][9]
Jungle disk does most of the heavy lifting. With most of my individual interactions using a mapped drive with [Jungle Disk][7] and [S3 Fox][8] in Firefox.

I don't feel [Amazon S3][4] is best storage solution for every person or business. I choose it primarily because it allows me to store data:

  * From Automated Back Ups
  * Manually
  * Programmatically in Web Applications
Most importantly because I have control over my data. I've been up there over over 2 years now. I've never lost any data. I pay a low price and I know I own my data.

It won't disappear when the start-up goes out of business or is acquired.

I keep my business files, taxes, music, photos, videos and much more up there. My data is important, and I will pay to keep it organized in one place in clouds.

[Amazon S3][4] has overwhelmingly won over my continued business.
