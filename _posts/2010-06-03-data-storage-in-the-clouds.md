{% include JB/setup %}I have been answering a lot of questions on LinkedIn and Quora lately about where the best place to store data in the clouds. There are a lot of answers to this question.
Cloud storage comes in many shapes, sizes, and prices. Business class, personal usage, storage APIs and much more.
I store my:

	Amazon EC2 machine images in Amazon S3
	Server data, logs and files in Amazon  S3
	Personal workstation back ups in Amazon  S3
	Images on Picasa, Flickr, and Zip up originals and upload to Amazon  S3
	Documents (Word, PDF, Spreadsheets) in Google Docs (FREE and Google App)

I overwhelmingly use Amazon S3. I get my data there using 3 different methods:

	Jungle Disk Backups and Mapped Network Drives
	Firefox S3 Fox Add-On
	Cross FTP Client

Jungle disk does most of the heavy lifting. With most of my individual interactions using a mapped drive with Jungle Disk and S3 Fox in Firefox.
I don't feel Amazon  S3 is best storage solution for every person or business. I choose it primarily because it allows me to store data:

	From Automated Back Ups
	Manually
	Programmatically in Web Applications

Most importantly because I have control over my data. I've been up there over over 2 years now. I've never lost any data. I pay a low price and I know I own my data.
It won't disappear when the start-up goes out of business or is acquired.
I keep my business files, taxes, music, photos, videos and much more up there. My data is important, and I will pay to keep it organized in one place in clouds.
Amazon  S3 has overwhelmingly won over my continued business.
