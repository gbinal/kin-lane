    With the amount of data being made available every day, visualizing tools are increasingly important. <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 15px;" title="US Map Visualization" src=
    "http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/US-Map.PNG" alt="" width="300" align="right" /> The average user needs to see data rolled up in a way that is attractive and easy to understand. I'm
    going to be keeping my eye out for easy to use tools that help us data scientist transform data into meaningful visualizations. I found an <a href=
    "http://www.flashusamap.com/statistics.php">Interactive Flash US Map</a> that you can easily plug in the criteria for each US State. The only thing I would add is for them to make a more variable
    API that allows people to connect the data source of their choice, like a Google Spreadsheet.
