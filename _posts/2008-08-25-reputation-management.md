I was Googling my name as I usually do on a Monday morning as part of my personal [reputation management][1].

I noticed a social network profile I signed up for a few months back called [Naymz][2] has grown significantly in PageRank as well as made it to the first page on my Google Results.

So I figured I better work to complete my profile on it and make it as robust and relevant as possible to the conversation(s) I have positioned myself in.

[Naymz][2] looks like it has become a great social network profile to use in your [online reputation management campaign][1].
