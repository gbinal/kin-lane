    So I have signed up for the Cloud Slam 09 Virtual Technology Conference. Looks like some greate speakers and sessions on the topic of Cloud Computing. I am interesting in the topic as well as how
    well a virtual conference will go. How many users, involvement level, etc. What I want to note in this blog post is that the conference is a week long, which is fine. But on each session I want
    to be able to click on link and have it automatically added to my Google Calendar with a reminder. Because it is a virtual conference and a week long, I am bound to get busy and I would like to
    be able to pick and choose the important sessions and have my Google Calendar remind me about it...right before.
