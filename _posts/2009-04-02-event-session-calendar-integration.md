    So I have signed up for the Cloud Slam 09 Virtual Technology Conference.Looks like some greate speakers and sessions on the topic of Cloud Computing.I am interesting in the topic as well as how
    well a virtual conference will go.How many users, involvement level, etc.What I want to note in this blog post is that the conference is a week long, which is fine.
