    I have a central keyword list that I use as a reference on a daily basis.I track these keywords across many tools from Google Reader, Google Webmaster, Google Analytics, and Wordpress.These
    keywords help me identify important topics that I then follow, learn about and develop content around.Within my Google Reader I tag content in real-time using my central keyword list.I recently
    started sharing these keywords as public RSS feeds.
