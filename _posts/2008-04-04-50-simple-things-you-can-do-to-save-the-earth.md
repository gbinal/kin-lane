My wife and I just finished launching a new site for a client called 50 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth.  It is the revised, updated edition of a book originally released in the 1990's and was New York Times bestseller.We have been working hard for 3 months to design, develop and launch the site to support he book's release by Earth Day.It is a significant site for us.  It is our first major release on the Original Web Solutions Version 4.0 Architecture and if I must say is a really nice site. We are really proud of the design and architecture.  It uses the OWS Network build methodology deployed on the Mosso Hosting Cloud to support the amount of traffic.  In the first 12 hours we have had 500 people. Also this site is exciting because of its simple approach to enlightening the world about little things they can do to save the world!Make sure and check it out.  www.50simplethings.com.
