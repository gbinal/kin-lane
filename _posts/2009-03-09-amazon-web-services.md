{% include JB/setup %}<p>I figured I had better posting something technology related or my blog is gonna start looking like some sort of consumer report or rant and raves blog.
Seems like the more I talk about and use Amazon Web Services the more questions and people I get wanting to talk about it.
Get random people using the GTalk chad module on my blog, and people through my company who have business acquaintances that want to learn from our experience and our pains.
The push to learn what Amazon's Cloud has to offer your business is growing.
I know it has changed the way I do business, hope it can change yours too!</p>
