{% include JB/setup %}Youtube finally has reworked their API to allow for uploading of videos. This was a huge problem in integrating YouTube in Social Media Campaigns.Here are some of the things you can do with the YouTube Data API now:Create a web front end to let people view videos about specific topics. Create a desktop application or plugin that plays videos in a customized environment. Add related, dynamic video content to your website or application. Customise the Flash player to fit the look and feel of your site, device or application Add feeds of videos from each of YouTube's 18 international domains The upload was the biggest addition for me. It is something that I have wanted for a while now.However the cool new chrome JavaScript player is pretty awesome too. You can really customize and embed a new user video player experience in any site.
