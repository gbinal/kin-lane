Youtube finally has reworked their API to allow for uploading of videos. This was a huge problem in [integrating YouTube in Social Media Campaigns][1].

Here are some of the things you can do with the [YouTube Data API][2] now:


  * Create a web front end to let people view videos about specific topics.
  * Create a desktop application or plugin that plays videos in a customized environment.
  * Add related, dynamic video content to your website or application.
  * Customise the Flash player to fit the look and feel of your site, device or application
  * Add feeds of videos from each of YouTube's 18 international domains
The upload was the biggest addition for me. It is something that I have wanted for a while now.However the cool new chrome JavaScript player is pretty awesome too. You can really customize and embed a new user video player experience in any site.
