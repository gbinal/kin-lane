{% include JB/setup %}Was just reading a post by Ian Forrester called, Is having a Routine good, bad or indifferent?.  It is nice to see other technology professionals struggling with the same problem.  I am always working to have a balance between routine and "following the wind".I would say I lean more toward "following the wind" and less on routine.  I always have to work harder to inject more routine into my day. Part of it is the amount of work I have, and my routine tends to get dictated by the loudest clients.  Which is unfair to the rest of my world.I am sure my Mom would like to see me have more routine that included communicating with her.  I think that will definitely be an item I work into my routine more in 2008.Thanks Ian.
