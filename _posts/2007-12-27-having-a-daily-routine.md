    Was just reading a post by Ian Forrester called, Is having a Routine good, bad or indifferent?It is nice to see other technology professionals struggling with the same problem.I am always working
    to have a balance between routine and following the wind.I would say I lean more toward following the wind and less on routine.I always have to work harder to inject more routine into my day.
