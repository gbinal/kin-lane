{% include JB/setup %}<p>I stopped using my Instagram account this week.I migrated all of my photos to Flickr, and removed Instagram from my iPhone.I&rsquo;m doing this in protest of the recent Instagram terms of service change.At this point, no matter what position they take, it shows they stopped giving a shit about solving problems for Instagram users, and are more focused on revenue.But the move to Flickr wasn&rsquo;t that big of a switch.</p>
