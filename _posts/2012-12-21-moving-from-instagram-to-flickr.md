    I stopped using my Instagram account this week.I migrated all of my photos to Flickr, and removed Instagram from my iPhone.I’m doing this in protest of the recent Instagram terms of service
    change.At this point, no matter what position they take, it shows they stopped giving a shit about solving problems for Instagram users, and are more focused on revenue.But the move to Flickr
    wasn’t that big of a switch.
