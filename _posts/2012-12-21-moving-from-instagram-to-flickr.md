I stopped using my Instagram account this week. I [migrated all of my photos to Flickr][1], and removed Instagram from my iPhone.

I’m doing this in protest of the [recent Instagram terms of service change][2]. At this point, no matter what position they take, it shows they stopped giving a shit about solving problems for Instagram users, and are more focused on revenue.

But the move to Flickr wasn’t that big of a switch. I only started using Instagram 2 years ago, where I’ve been using Flickr since January of 2007. I’ve also paid for Flickr Pro since 2008.

So while I used Instagram, because they made photo taking on my iPhone interesting, and allowed me to easily share my photos--it didn’t take much to migrate back to [Flickr][3].

[Flickr had just come out with a new iPhone application][4] that did everything Instagram did for me, and since I never really got plugged into the whole Instagram social network--abandoning the platform didn't take much thought.

I’ll leave my Instagram account up, so I can test on the API and play with the platform in the future. But all of my photos will be published using Flickr from now on.
