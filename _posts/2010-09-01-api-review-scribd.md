    potential for integration into applications. As I'm going through I"m also evaluating how they deliver their API community. I was checking out the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/developers"
    target="_blank">Scribd API</a> tonight, and I like their delivery. Its pretty straightforward. It has the following API building blocks:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>API Overview
      </li>
      <li>Sign Up for an API Account
      </li>
      <li>API Tutorials
      </li>
      <li>Client Libraries
      </li>
      <li>User Authentication Overview
      </li>
      <li>Usage Limits
      </li>
      <li>Javascript API
      </li>
      <li>Mobile and E-Reader API and SDK
      </li>
      <li>Enterprise SDK
      </li>
      <li>Help / Support
      </li>
      <li>FAQ
      </li>
    </ul>They make it easy to sign up for an API account by providing links in navigation and on home page. They provide client libraries in these programming language:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Ruby
      </li>
      <li>Java
      </li>
      <li>PHP
      </li>
      <li>C# / .NET
      </li>
      <li>ActionScript 3.0
      </li>
      <li>Python
      </li>
    </ul>They just make it easy to get up and going by providing the necessary information and tools. Its a good example to follow when deploying an API.
