I have been reviewing a lot of APIs lately. I"m evaluating their potential for integration into applications.
As I'm going through I"m also evaluating how they deliver their API community.
I was checking out the Scribd API tonight, and I like their delivery. Its pretty straightforward.
It has the following API building blocks:

	API Overview
	Sign Up for an API Account
	API Tutorials
	Client Libraries
	User Authentication Overview
	Usage Limits
	Javascript API
	Mobile and E-Reader API and SDK
	Enterprise SDK
	Help / Support
	FAQ

They make it easy to sign up for an API account by providing links in navigation and on home page.
They provide client libraries in these programming language:

	Ruby
	Java
	PHP
	C# / .NET
	ActionScript 3.0
	Python

They just make it easy to get up and going by providing the necessary information and tools.
Its a good example to follow when deploying an API.
