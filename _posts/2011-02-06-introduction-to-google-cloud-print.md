    I have been studying Google Cloud Print since they announced it last year.Even though you dont catch me printing very often, I am fascinated by the technology and its potential.Google Cloud Print
    enables any application (web, desktop, mobile) on any device to print to any printer.Applications submit print jobs to the cloud print service via the API offered by Google.Google Cloud Print
    then sends the print job to the selected printer which the user has previously registered with the service.
