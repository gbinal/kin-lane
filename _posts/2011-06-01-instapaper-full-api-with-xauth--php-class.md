{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im working my way through a list of projects I have, and currently theInstapaper API is top of my list.I couldnt find an easy to use PHP class for authenticating against Instapapers Full API using XAuth.So I downloaded @abraham Twitter OAuth and stripped out all as much of theunnecessarypieces as I could.I was quickly able to get it up and running authenticating with Instapapers Full API usingXAuth.I added two basic methods for:

	Listing Instapaper Bookmarks
	Pulling Full Text of Instapaper Bookmark

I will add more methods later for other Instapaper API endpoints.</p>
