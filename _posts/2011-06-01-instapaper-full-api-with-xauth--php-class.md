    using XAuth.So I downloaded @abraham Twitter OAuth and stripped out all as much of theunnecessarypieces as I could.I was quickly able to get it up and running authenticating with Instapapers Full
    API usingXAuth.I added two basic methods for: Listing Instapaper Bookmarks Pulling Full Text of Instapaper Bookmark I will add more methods later for other Instapaper API endpoints.
