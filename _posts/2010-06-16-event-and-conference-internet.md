    After writing a little about the pathetic state of event and conference Wifi and 3G Internet Ive continued going through my notes on this subject.I really need to make progress in this area for
    events I manage, so I would like to put out the word that Im looking for partners, both financial and technical to make a company that could deliver in this area.Here is what I envision.A company
    that can deliver: Last Mile Internet on Demand - Delivery rapid roll out, high quality broadband Internet (43mbps) to facilities as needed Relationships - Negotiate relationships with existing
    ISP in and around major cities and facilities to provide hard connections on demand.Technology - Using non line of site and line of site wireless technology to delivery last mile Internet on
    demand.
