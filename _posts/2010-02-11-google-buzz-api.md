Over the next several months Google Buzz begin rolling out APIs for developers. Our plans involve full/read write support for updates with the [Atom Publishing Protocol][1], rich activity notification with [Activity Streams][2], delegated authorization with [OAuth][3], federated comments and activities with [Salmon][4], distributed profile and contact information with [WebFinger][5], and much, much more. We invite developers to join us in these conversations on the [Buzz API Group][6].
