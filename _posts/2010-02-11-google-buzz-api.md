{% include JB/setup %}Over the next several months Google Buzz begin rolling out APIs for   developers.  Our plans involve full/read write support for updates   with the Atom   Publishing Protocol, rich activity notification   with Activity Streams,   delegated authorization with OAuth,   federated comments and activities   with Salmon,   distributed profile and contact information   with WebFinger, and much, much more.  We invite   developers to join us in these conversations on   the Buzz   API Group.
