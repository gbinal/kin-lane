    I am really finding one consistent them across my cloud server architecture lately.It is was I am calling roles.These are server roles that meet specific business goals, such as: PHP Web Server
    ColdFusion Web Server.NET Web Server SQL 2008 Database Server MySQL Database Server SMTP Server POP Server DNS Server FTP Server Subversion (SVN) Server These are specific server roles that get
    my work done and allow teams and companies I work with to get their jobs done.Defining server instance roles allows me to designate specic machine purposes that I can deploy as Amazon Instances
    rapidly.
