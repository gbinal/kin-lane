    Email has become my number one enemy lately.It is sure tough to ensure the quality receipt of emails when your are doing large email blasts.You have to start at the DNS and Server Configuration
    and make sure your domain email records are setup correctly to reflect your email send / receipt infrastructure.You have to make sure your server is configured correctly and IP Address, naming
    ,etc is all in sync with your DNS records.Then we start talking content, what content is going to trigger SPAM filters.
