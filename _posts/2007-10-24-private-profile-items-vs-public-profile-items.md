    There is a lot of information that exists in a dual format in my public and private life. A lot of what I do I don't mind it being public. That is my personality.<br />
    <br />
    However there are items that I have to or want to keep private. These items I usually want to keep completely private or maybe make portions of it private.<br />
    <br />
    Therefore a separation between all items I work with to have the option to share or keep to myself. Of course everything defaults to being private unless I set a default setting to say otherwise
    for that item.
