    Google finally launched the reborn Jotspot as Google sites.It is slick and elegant and acts as I thought it would as a Google App.It seamlessly integrates with other Google Apps.However it seems
    to be only launched for Google Apps?Which is continuing the confusion about the separation between my Google Apps for My Domain and my FREE primary Google Account which I use heavily.
