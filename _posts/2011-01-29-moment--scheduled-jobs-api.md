    A big part of the web applications I build, is usually some sort of jobs management.Most functionality is triggered based upon user generated events.However there are many times where I need to
    schedule something as a job.I run most of my web applications on a Windows 2008 server, this is the platform Im most familiar with.So I use the task scheduler built into the platform.
