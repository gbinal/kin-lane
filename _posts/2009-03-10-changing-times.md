    I watched a special on Oregon Public Broadcasting the other night about the history of the Columbia River Gorge.It showcased the history of the gorge through the photography available from
    various people.It is amazing to see the history and how it has changed over time, and somewhat sad to see what happened to the river after the Bonneville Damn was put in.Much of the rivers
    history was lost.Anyways it was interesting to see how different industries thrived along the river at different times and how they declined because of changes.
