One trend I'm seeing more of lately, is the migration of existing open-source technologies into the clouds, transforming them into Software as a Service<img class="c1" title="Full-Text Indexing" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/software-as-a-service/websolr.PNG" alt="" width="113" height="50" align="right" />

As the cloud stack keep evolving you see some excellent examples of cloud service providers doing one thing, and doing it well. So you don't have to.

I stumbled across [websolr][1] today, which is cloud [Software as a Service (SaaS)][2] implementation of the robust [Apache Solr search server][3].

[websolr][1] is [full-text search implemented in the clouds][4]. [websolr][1] allows you to easily deploy full-text searching for your site or application.

In this world of ever growing cloud services you can focus on what you do best and use other great tools such as [ZenDesk][5] for support and [websolr][1] for full-text search.
