    One trend Im seeing more of lately, is the migration of existing open-source technologies into the clouds, transforming them into Software as a Service As the cloud stack keep evolving you see
    some excellent examples of cloud service providers doing one thing, and doing it well.So you dont have to.I stumbled across websolr today, which is cloud Software as a Service (SaaS)
    implementation of the robust Apache Solr search server.websolr is full-text search implemented in the clouds.websolr allows you to easily deploy full-text searching for your site or application.
