One trend I'm seeing more of lately, is the migration of existing open-source technologies into the clouds, transforming them into Software as a Service
As the cloud stack keep evolving you see some excellent examples of cloud service providers doing one thing, and doing it well. So you don't have to.
I stumbled across websolr today, which is cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation of the robust Apache Solr search server.
websolr is full-text search implemented in the clouds. websolr allows you to easily deploy full-text searching for your site or application.
In this world of ever growing cloud services you can focus on what you do best and use other great tools such as ZenDesk for support and websolr for full-text search.
