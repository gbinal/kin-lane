    I was just refining a wiki page of various building blocks I use at Amazon Web Services.I noticed it would make a great Internet Service Provider (ISP) package for someone who wanted to start an
    ISP, or even used as model for an existing ISP looking to migrate to cloud computing.These are a few of the components I have my list: Web Server on Amazon EC2 Linux / Windows EBS Volumes for
    Storage Machine Images Amazon S3 Central File Storage + Jungle Disk Server Backup Central File Storage Client Cloud Storage as a Service FTP Access Database SQL Server 2008 MySQL Amazon RDS Other
    (Amazon SimpleDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, etc) Email POP Server SMTP Server DNS Server FTP Server Web File Access Central File Storage Access SVN Server Version Repositories Client Checkout These are
    just a few of the building blocks I have on my list.There are many other possibilities and configurations.You slap on an ISP Cloud Management tool like Plesk from Parallels and you can manage
    your network without much headache.
