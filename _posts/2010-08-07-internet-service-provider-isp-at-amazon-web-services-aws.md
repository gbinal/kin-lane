I was just refining a wiki page of various building blocks I use at Amazon Web Services. I noticed it would make a great Internet Service Provider (ISP) package for someone who wanted to start an ISP, or even used as model for an existing ISP looking to migrate to cloud computing.
These are a few of the components I have my list:

	Web Server on Amazon EC2

	Linux / Windows
	EBS Volumes for Storage
	Machine Images


	Amazon S3 Central File Storage + Jungle Disk

	Server Backup
	Central File Storage
	Client Cloud Storage as a Service
	FTP Access


	Database

	SQL Server 2008
	MySQL
	Amazon RDS
	Other (Amazon SimpleDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, etc)


	Email

	POP Server
	SMTP Server


	DNS Server
	FTP Server

	Web File Access
	Central File Storage Access


	SVN Server

	Version Repositories
	Client Checkout



These are just a few of the building blocks I have on my list. There are many other possibilities and configurations. You slap on an ISP Cloud Management tool like Plesk from Parallels and you can manage your network without much headache.
You are going to see many Internet Service Providers (ISP) make the jump to the cloud because of cost and ease of deployment. There are just too many benefits to ignore the cloud.
