     <img class="alignnone c1" title="Zeus Software" src="http://www.zeus.com/assets/img/logo.gif"  width="156" height="50" align="right" />I was just reviewing the cloud tools offered by <a href="http://www.zeus.com/" target="_blank">Zeus</a>. I was researching <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/global-server-load-balancing/">Global server Load Balancing (Cloud Balancing)</a> software yesterday and they were on my list. Unfortunately I used an image from their software and neglected to mention them in my post. I just spent the last couple hours reviewing their tools and 3 specific products stand out:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/multi-site-manager/index.html" target="_blank">Multi-Site Manager</a> - Tools for managing applications that span multiple, geographically distributed, data-centers and cloud providers.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/global-load-balancer/index.html" target="_blank">Global Load Balancer</a> - DNS solutions for managing traffic on geographic locations and data center performance and availability.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.zeus.com/products/traffic-manager/index.html" target="_blank">Traffic Manager</a> - Manage your application traffic across distributed locations.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     These are the products they offer that fall under my "cloud application" label. They also offer firewall, load balancers, and web servers. They have locations in:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Cambridge, UK
     </li>
     <li>San Mateo, CA US
     </li>
     <li>Rome, Italy
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Interesting set of products. I'm working through their case studies and white papers to learn more. I just wanted to review their company and core products, and post to my <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/kinlane.com/cloud-computing/players/zeus" target="_blank">cloud computing service provider wiki</a>.
