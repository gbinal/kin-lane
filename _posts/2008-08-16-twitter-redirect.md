{% include JB/setup %}I was just reading a Techcrunch blog post on the the local services market Workstir.com.I went and signed up to be notified for the private beta.Then after I signed up it gave me the following option on the thank you page:In the meantime, if you could help us out by tweeting about Workstir, that would be amazing!It gave me a twitter login, then took me to the twitter site.Pretty smooth move, I just helped them in their social media marketing.
