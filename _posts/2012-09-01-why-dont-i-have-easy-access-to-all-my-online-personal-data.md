    I was just downloading all of my Facebook data.You can go under your account settings and there is a little link that lets you download everything.&nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full
    archive, but once my archive is ready, theyâ€™ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like.While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer.Google has an
    amazing acount management dashboard which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their takeout service which gives you downloads for individual
    services and across multiple services.
