    As the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist, I get asked why I would be an evangelist for technology in a dying industry.Print and Publishing.My primary argument is: Through new technology
    such as cloud computing, social media, and mobile the print and publishing industry will be redefined.We wont even recognize it as the old beast.One example of this is Shapeways.
