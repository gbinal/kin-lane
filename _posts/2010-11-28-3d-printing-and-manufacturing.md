As the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist, I get asked why I would be an evangelist for technology in a dying industry. Print and Publishing.

My primary argument is: Through new technology such as cloud computing, social media, and mobile the print and publishing industry will be redefined. We won't even recognize it as the old beast.

One example of this is [Shapeways][1]. Shapeways turns 3D designs and drawings to tangible products through 3D printing. <img src="http://cdn.venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/shapeways_logo.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /> You can choose from their pre-defined creators to build proven products, partner with other designers to create a product or upload your own designs to the Shapeways platform.

[Shapeways][1] will check your 3D model that you upload to make sure it can be printed properly before sending to their production facility.

Once in production, the 3D model in your digital file will be printed layer by layer using one of four 3D printing machines
