{% include JB/setup %}Was able to find a couple hours today to read everything in my inbox regarding my cloud computing research. Thanks for those of you who responded and are getting involved.
It was a busy week for me preparing for the SAP Sapphire event in Orlando in May (and will be more very busy weeks to come until everything is done 5/15).
So I won't have much time for me extracurriculur learning and research.
I did make it through my inbox, but only part of my RSS Feeds. I got some good thoughts out and bookmarked my next round of research that I will be posting to my cloud computing research site. So stay tuned.
