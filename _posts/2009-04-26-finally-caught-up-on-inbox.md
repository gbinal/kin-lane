    Was able to find a couple hours today to read everything in my inbox regarding my cloud computing research.Thanks for those of you who responded and are getting involved.It was a busy week for me
    preparing for the SAP Sapphire event in Orlando in May (and will be more very busy weeks to come until everything is done 5/15).So I wont have much time for me extracurriculur learning and
    research.I did make it through my inbox, but only part of my RSS Feeds.
