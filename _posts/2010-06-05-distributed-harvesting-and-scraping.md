    Data is the center of my world.I enjoy that there are finally great places on the Internet get open large data sets such as Factual and Google Fusion Tables.However much of the data I want for
    different purposes is not neatly organized into an easily accessible data set or available on the Internet.When I see data on the Internet that is controlled and not widely available I get the
    urge to set it free.Help the data owner organize it and make it available.
