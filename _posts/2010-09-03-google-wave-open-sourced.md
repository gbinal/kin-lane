{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was happy to see the announcement by Google, that they were open sourcing more of the Google Wave platform.I was at the keynote speech where they released Google Wave, and I really believed in the potential of it as a platform.The code they released adds more features and delivers a more complete Wave in a Box solution.This project will include:

	An application bundle including a server and web client supporting real-time collaboration using the same structured conversations as the Google Wave system
	A fast and fully-featured wave panel in the web client with complete support for threaded conversations
	A persistent wave store and search implementation for the server (building on contributed patches to implement a MongoDB store)
	Refinements to the client-server protocols
	Gadget, robot and data API support
	Support for importing wave data from wave.google.</p>
