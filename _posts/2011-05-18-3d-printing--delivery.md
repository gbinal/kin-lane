{% include JB/setup %}<p>3D printing is about delivering a virtual object as a physical object, on demand.This is where our current shipping industry steps in;  UPS, Fedex, USPS, DHS and other shipping providers will make sure we receive our 3D printed objects.With growing fuel costs, the need for localized delivery will grow, and here is another area where 3D printing will excel.3D printers can be localized and deliver parts and products locally, with only the need to ship raw materials.As the green revolution continues, 3D printing will become a key player providing localized manufacturing, and potentially printing made of more sustainable raw materials.</p>
