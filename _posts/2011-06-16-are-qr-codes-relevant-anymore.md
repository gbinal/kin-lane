    A Quick Response (QR) code is a two-dimensional code that is readable by barcode readers as well as camera phones.QR Codes have been around since 1994, and every couple years seem to get heralded
    as the next big thing.QR Codes can be used to link the offline world, with online information, with single scan or snap of a picture.QR codes can contain links that take users to a web page.If a
    user sees a barcode on a store-front window, or on a flyer on telephone pole, they can can snap a picture using their phone and be routed to a web page.
