    I am spending an hour or two each week and working with my mother and her business partner on growing their small business.Last weekend I spend some time in Ashland coming back from California
    and helped them talk through their business.We identified some problems in their supply chain, however they are making great strides in documenting and streamlining this process.Where we
    identified that they teed help is in content development and online distribution and marketing.I dubbed this project Content Chain.
