    Lots of big news coming out of Apples World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC2011) in San Francisco today.There were major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion.What
    really stood out was their new iCloud.iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for all music, photos, books, documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.Although this
    line of thought is nothing new, with Apple going all in.
