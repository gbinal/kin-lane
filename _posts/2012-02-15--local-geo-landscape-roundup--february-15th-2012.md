  * [Early Success Stories: Timeline Apps and Open Graph][8] - (02/15/2012) - img. border { border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: #CCCCCC;} There should be an app for everyone on Facebook, and people are quickly starting to use the apps you build to experience all of the things they love shopping, reading books, eating and traveling with their friends. A few weeks ago, more than 60 new timeline apps went live. These apps - many in the lifestyle category - broadened what was available to people on Facebook beyond the music, news and video apps that were introduced at f8 in September. Music apps like Spotify, Songza and Deezer are seeing dramatic increases in sharing and music discovery.
  * [Announcing The Facebook Mobile Platform Global Hacks Roadshow- Europe][8] - (02/13/2012) - In October, we announced the Facebook Mobile Platform, bringing social channels and distribution to mobile apps. Since then, momentum has been building, and today, more than 60 million visitors interact with apps and games on the platform every month. In October we also invited mobile developers to join us for a Mobile Hack in Palo Alto. We later visited mobile developers in New York and Boston to hold similar events. Hundreds joined us at each event, learned about the Facebook Mobile Platform, worked on mobile hack projects, and presented them to panels of VCs and tech executives. We were thrilled that these mobile hack events attracted developers from around the world, from as far afield as London, Israel and Brazil.
  * [Platform Updates: Operation Developer Love][8] - (02/10/2012) - This week, we posted blogs on Creating Featured Stories with Action Specs and Developer Blog Subscriptions.

  * [Developer Blog Subscriptions][8] - (02/08/2012) - We recently launched the ability to manage your email subscriptions on the Developer Site: A month ago, we discovered a bug in our Developer Blog email subscriptions that prevented posts from getting emailed. We fixed this bug today and sent out all posts that were never delivered. This ensured that you didn't miss any important announcements (some posts dated back to mid-January). We apologize for sending the emails all at once and any confusion that this may have caused. Please let us know if you have any questions in the comments below.

  * [Infochimps at Strata Conference 2012][14] - (02/10/2012) - We’re excited to have our CTO, Flip Kromer presenting a talk at Strata Conference in Santa Clara later this month. The discussion centers arounddisambiguation. Now you might be wondering… what is disambiguation? Simply put, disambiguation is the process of resolving conflicts to remove ambiguity. We’ve discussed this topic a number of times in this blog and Flip will be presenting on how this concept affects the way we ask questions and find answers about Big Data. For more details on the talk, check out the Strata schedule.
