     I have a "hobby" harvesting project going on right now. I'm am harvesting several thousand web pages from various locations on a certain topic. I'm not really interested in the content itself, but the top keywords that are used in the content. I pulled the page and extracted the body content that I am interested in analyzing. I then want to pull a list of the top keywords and key phrases used in the page. So I am faced with next steps:
</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
     <li>Spend time researching algorithms for parsing text and looking for words
     </li>
     <li>Write my own scripts for identifying key words and key phrases (harder than you think)
     </li>
     <li>Evolve and continue scripts to make more intelligent over time
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
     <img class="alignnone c1" title="AlchemyAPI" src="http://www.alchemyapi.com/images/alchemyAPI.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="57" align="right" />There is a lot of time and money investment there. Easy to give up on my project at this point. I start looking for existing tools or APIs that would accomplish this. I came across a great <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">tag, keyword, and key phrase intelligence API</a> called <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">AlchemyAPI</a>. They have a great API that takes content, and returns an intelligent set of tags. Now I am one more step closer to being able to <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/08/meaningful-key-phrases-and-tag-sets/" target="_blank">extract meaningful key phrases and tag sets</a>. It is also a great example of how good Application Programming Interface (API) can assist developers in delivering projects.
