    I was sitting in a pub last night drinking a beer and organizing my home photos so I could share with my ex-wife.I was uploading images in various zipped folders into different buckets in my
    Amazon S3 storage in the cloud.I was also uploading various zipped folders from my web application development businesss I ran for 8 years.All the project, accounting and business information for
    all that time.While this was going on I was ready a document from the Center for Strategic and International Studies called Securing Cyberspace for the 44th Presidency.
