    The end of the year is a great time for reflection.2012 was kind of a blur, and with the amount of API Evangelism I did, I had little time to reflect on where I went and the places I enjoyed.I
    wanted a quick way to create some kind of visualization, showing where i had been over the year.&nbsp;Foursquare was the first placed I looked and using Singly I was quickly able to pull my year
    of checkins.This is just one question I want to ask of my online digital world.
