{% include JB/setup %}<p>Once again Im pushing the limits of what Im allowed within an Amazon Web Services account.I need more server instances and more reserved IP addresses.So I have to go to the form(s) Amazon provides to:

	Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit
	Request to Increase Elastic IP Address Limit

They take about 3-5 days to get back to you and let you know if you are approved.Ive never been denied, because all the accounts I run are for reputable companies.Its an interesting control feature for managing the quality of tenants on the Amazon Cloud.</p>
