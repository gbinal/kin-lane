     Once again I'm pushing the limits of what I"m allowed within an Amazon Web Services account. I need more server instances and more reserved IP addresses. So I have to go to the form(s) Amazon provides to: Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit Request to Increase Elastic IP Address Limit They take about 3-5 days to get back to you and let you know if you are approved. I've never been denied, because all the accounts I run are for reputable companies. Its an interesting control feature for managing the quality of tenants on the Amazon Cloud.
