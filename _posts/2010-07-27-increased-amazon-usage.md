    Once again Im pushing the limits of what Im allowed within an Amazon Web Services account.I need more server instances and more reserved IP addresses.So I have to go to the form(s) Amazon
    provides to: Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit Request to Increase Elastic IP Address Limit They take about 3-5 days to get back to you and let you know if you are approved.Ive never
    been denied, because all the accounts I run are for reputable companies.Its an interesting control feature for managing the quality of tenants on the Amazon Cloud.
