[ePrint][1] is a service from HP that allows printing to select HP printers over the Internet.

When an HP web connected printer registers it gets an email address. Since printers receive print jobs by email, this enables printing to any HP web enabled printer that is connected to the Internet.

[ePrint][1] enables printing from any smart phone, tablet or laptop, but is only available using HP printers.

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/HP-ePrint/HP-ePrint-Overview.png" alt="" width="600" />][2] Each HP web connected printers registers itself with the HP ePrint Center, providing a central cloud based area to manage print jobs.

ePrint Center also provides other resources like applications, software, and document templates, including:

  * [Marketsplash][3] \- Professional marketing materials
  * [Creative Studio for Home][4] \- Home print resources
  * [Creative Studio for Business][5] \- Business print resources.
HP provides several [home and business web connected printers][6] for use with HP ePrint center.
