    I see a lot of conference badges.WebEvents Global specializes in print on demand badges that make the conference check-in experience a breeze.I just finished reading a blot post about Book on a
    Hook, a badge from The Web and Beyond 2010 event, held in Amsterdam.They showcase badge being a useful as book that the attendee can actually get value out of, beyond just identification.Google
    I/O created a very informative and entertaining booklet for their 2009 event.
