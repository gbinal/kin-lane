I see a lot of conference badges. [WebEvents Global][1] specializes in print on demand badges that make the conference check-in experience a breeze. <img class="alignnone c1" title="Google I/O" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/3574278779_e26a7c1f3d.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />

I just finished reading a blot post about [Book on a Hook][2], a badge from [The Web and Beyond 2010][3] event, held in Amsterdam.

They showcase badge being a useful as book that the attendee can actually get value out of, beyond just identification.

[Google I/O][4] created a very informative and entertaining booklet for their 2009 event.

I'm not 100% sold on the usefulness of your badge being a book, but I can how for some events it might work well.

I've brainstormed with various people on what makes the perfect event badge, from a high tech RFID card to giving every attendee an IPod Touch for use as a badge.

I would like to hear other innovative ideas for badges from attendees and event managers.
