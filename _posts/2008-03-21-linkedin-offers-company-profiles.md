{% include JB/setup %}LinkedIn just announced they are offering that, "Now Companies too have profiles on LinkedIn".I have always used LinkedIn as a business facing presence for myself.  It has linkages for all my employees?Now, you'll be able to see over 160,000 profiles of companies on LinkedIn, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to non-profit organizations as well as LinkedIn's own Company Profile page.Company Profiles on LinkedIn is an overview of a company's industry data in combination with LinkedIn data along certain key metrics.Seems like a logical step to me.What can it do for a business to have a social network profile on LinkedIn?
