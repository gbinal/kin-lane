    LinkedIn just announced they are offering that, "<a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/blog/2008/03/company-profile.html">Now Companies too have profiles on LinkedI</a>n".<br />
    <br />
    I have always used LinkedIn as a business facing presence for myself. It has linkages for all my employees?<br />
    <br />
    Now, you'll be able to see over 160,000 profiles of companies on LinkedIn, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to non-profit organizations as well as LinkedIn's own Company Profile page.<br />
    <br />
    Company Profiles on LinkedIn is an overview of a company's industry data in combination with LinkedIn data along certain key metrics.<br />
    <br />
    Seems like a logical step to me.<br />
    <br />
    What can it do for a business to have a social network profile on LinkedIn?
