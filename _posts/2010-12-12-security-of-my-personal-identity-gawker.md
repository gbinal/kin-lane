{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im watching the scene unfold with Gawker media, and thinking about the security of my personal identity.The security of our personal online identities has ALWAYS been important, it just has a spotlight on it currently with Wikileaks and all the high profile DDOS and intrusive attacks in the last couple of weeks.My first thought is how thankful I am I use a 3 tier username / password structure for all of my accounts.This means I have 3 different sets of username / passwords I use:

	3rd Party Accounts - These are all external 3rd party services I use.External / Public Facing Accounts - These are accounts I host but have public facing logins, like Wordpress, etc.</p>
