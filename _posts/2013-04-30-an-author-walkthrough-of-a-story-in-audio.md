    I was finally catching up on all my podcasts this week, which includes Traffic and Weather, which is an always informative source of news and commentary podcast about APIs and the cloud hosted
    by&nbsp;@smarx&nbsp;and&nbsp;@johnsheehan&nbsp; While listening to&nbsp;Episode 8: Iâ€™m going to withdraw my objection, John Sheehan discusses his March story in NextWeb called&nbsp;APIs are Dead,
    Long Live APIs.&nbsp;It was very interesting to hear him describe his intent behind the post and walk us through his points.&nbsp; I read the original article back in March, jotted down some
    notes, but really didnt trigger much beyond that.&nbsp;After listening to him talk about the post, it renewed some very interesting points for me--which Im working through an dyou will see in
    future blog posts.&nbsp; It is a lot of work to craft a good quality blog posts that conveys difficult and often abstract API concepts to a wide audience.
