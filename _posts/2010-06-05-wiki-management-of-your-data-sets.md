{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reviewing the Google Sites API today.I have a Google Site / Wiki that I was maintaining last year about cloud computing.Like other side projects of mine that dont directly have funding it fell to the wayside, however Ive been still bookmarking and gathering relevant data that still applies to this Cloud Computing Wik.I would like to find a way to refresh it.Google  Sites API and Google Docs API provide a great way to programmatically generate either private or public collections of your data.</p>
