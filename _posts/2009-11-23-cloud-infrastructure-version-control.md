{% include JB/setup %}<p>I use Subversion pretty religiously in our development environment.It bothers a lot of developers and other key people because it can be perceived as a bottle-neck.I am always amazed at how many organizations I work with (tech development shops) do not use subversion at all.I feel its mandatory.I would like to the development of a version control system that works on Amazon EC2 environment and even would work with Amazon Simple DB and Amazon S3.</p>
