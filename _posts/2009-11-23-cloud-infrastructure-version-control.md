    I use Subversion pretty religiously in our development environment.It bothers a lot of developers and other key people because it can be perceived as a bottle-neck.I am always amazed at how many
    organizations I work with (tech development shops) do not use subversion at all.I feel its mandatory.I would like to the development of a version control system that works on Amazon EC2
    environment and even would work with Amazon Simple DB and Amazon S3.
