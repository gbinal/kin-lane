{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have had several talks with small businesses about their comapnies infrastructure and what the next steps are.When I bring up cloud computing, the first question I get is in regards to security.How secure is our data, our apps?Valid questions and cloud service providers have a lot of proving to do here in alleviating the concerns of small and medium sized businesses wanting to move into the cloud.I agree I need more proof regarding how secure things are at Amazon or other cloud providers, but really I dont see much more proof when it comes to the hosting your servers and data at your favorite ISP and Hosting Provider.</p>
