    I was reminded today that nothing is permanent in the cloud.I accidentally terminated my primary database instance running on Amazon EC2.319 databases, 100 GB of data running on SQL Server 2008.I
    was removing 2 decommissioned server instances, I selected both of them and clicked terminate.About 60 seconds later I started getting alerts that my web sites are down.
