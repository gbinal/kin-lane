I am walking through the [Box.net OpenBox Developer][1] area tonight. [Box.net][2] offers a pretty robust set of API for managing files and content on the box.net platform.

It is a great example of a very robust API. They get you started with:

  * Introduction to OpenBox Actions
  * Getting Started Guide for API
  * Easy Sig-nup
  * Project Setup Page
They provide several flavors to their API:
  * REST
  * SOAP
  * XML-RPC
They provide some some great code samples and libraries in all the top programming languages.

They provide a list of of all their API functions right off the left hand menu, broken down into categories:

  * Authentication
  * File
