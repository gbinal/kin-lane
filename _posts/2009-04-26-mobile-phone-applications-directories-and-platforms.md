I was just reading about Research in Montion and their innovation in [Fast Company][1] and about their applicaiton directory in [Business Week][2].

I was also reading about [Vodafone][3] in Business Week.

Seems that open platforms and creating application directories are all the rage. All the mobile providers are seeing the success of namely [IPhone apps][4] and jumping on the band wagon.

So several thoughts are going through my head. Are mobile apps the next web? When you build a site for your company do you have to build applications for major mobile platforms too?

I am seeing [Android][5] being used for webbooks as well as [mobile phones][6]. It just seems like there were desktop apps, then there was the web. Now you have to consider [IPhone][7], Blackberry, Android and other top players now when building online / cloud tools for your company.

I am sure this is asking a lot of small businesses who just realized that building for the web is a priority. Seems like the next wave though. Cloud enabled applications that run on any top mobile or web environment.
