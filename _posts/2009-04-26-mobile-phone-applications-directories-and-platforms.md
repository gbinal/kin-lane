    I was just reading about Research in Montion and their innovation in Fast Company and about their applicaiton directory in Business Week.I was also reading about Vodafone in Business Week.Seems
    that open platforms and creating application directories are all the rage.All the mobile providers are seeing the success of namely IPhone apps and jumping on the band wagon.So several thoughts
    are going through my head.
