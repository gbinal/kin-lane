<p>As I prepare to go to Washington DC, to work with the Department of Veterans Affiars (VA), I'm spending a lot of time thinking about how I'll prepare for my year, working within the federal government. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Working for the White House, and at the VA, will most definitely be an entirely new experience for me, I feel my approach and experience within the API space will benefit me greatly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the tech, business and politics of APIs I don't see things as:</p>

<p>This approach to monitoring the API universe has allowed me to better understand the differences between APIs and the companie or individauls behind them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel this will help me understand how Washington works, and continue to find, simple, meaningful, API driven approaches to helping our government innovate.</p>
