[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/amazon/affiliate/amazon-affiliates.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1]Amazon sent me an email about the recent [signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown][2], which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.

As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the [Amazon Associates Program][1] are terminated effective today, June 29, 2011.

California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to[Amazon.com][3],[Endless.com][4],[MYHABIT.COM][5] and[SmallParts.com][6].

My Amazon Associate profile is registered to my California address, but I can easily change to my house in Oregon, to keep active.

Lawmakers calculate it will net the state $200 million in additional revenues. I can't help but think how many affiliates will just relocate out of state and conduct business outside of California.

These are Internet businesses, I don't think moving them will be very hard.
