     Amazon sent me an email about the recent signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores. As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated effective today, June 29, 2011. California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred toAmazon.com,Endless.com,MYHABIT.COM andSmallParts.com. My Amazon Associate profile is registered to my California address, but I can easily change to my house in Oregon, to keep active. Lawmakers calculate it will net the state $200 million in additional revenues. I can't help but think how many affiliates will just relocate out of state and conduct business outside of California. These are Internet businesses, I don't think moving them will be very hard.
