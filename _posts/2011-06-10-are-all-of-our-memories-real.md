{% include JB/setup %}<p>My 10 year old daughter Kaia and I were chatting last night about a old family friend that is coming to visit.She hasnt seen him since she was three years old.He showed up to the house, and she got back on chat and told me she doesnt remember him at all.She described what he looked like, and said she doesnt know him.I went to my Flickr account and went back in time to about 2003 and found some pictures of him carrying her and playing with her.</p>
