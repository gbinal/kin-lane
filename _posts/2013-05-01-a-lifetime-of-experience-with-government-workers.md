{% include JB/setup %}<p>I grew up in rural Oregon.One concept I was raised on and given healthy portions of, was a distrust of government workers.Government workers were lazy, predatory, beauracratic and definitely not working for the interests of anyone I encountered in the small town I grew up in.In contrast, during the last year of monitoring the White House Digital Strategy Ive learned a lot about how government operates, the mission of a handful of the 200+ federal agencies, and opened up conversations with multiple government workers, from a wide variety of government agencies.One thing that stands out, is how all of them are working in a state of public service.</p>
