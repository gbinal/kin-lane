    I just finished reading Asher Wolf’s Dear Hacker Community – We Need To Talk.I have so many emotions bubbling up, it’s hard to know how to organize them.I envy her for being able to express them
    so eloquently and in detail.First, before I cycle through some of my emotions.Please don’t leave the space Asher.
