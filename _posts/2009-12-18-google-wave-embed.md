I was playing with [Google Wave][1] tonight. I am curious to see how I can use it. I keep thinking about using Google Wave as a [content management system][2] (CMS).

I am starting with the basics. First I started a new wave and filled it with some dummy content.

Then using the [Google Wave Embed API][3] I can quickly grab the Wave ID and embed it in a web page using a simple little JavaScript that creates and manipulates a Google Wave Embed Panel.
