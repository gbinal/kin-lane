    Like everyone else, I struggle with keeping track of my time.What projects did I work on, how much time did I spend researching, reading and writing each day.Ive used Bascamp, Microsoft Project
    and even spreadsheets to track time in the past.Each solution always starts the same.There is a honeymoon period where I keep everything up to date, and it works well.
