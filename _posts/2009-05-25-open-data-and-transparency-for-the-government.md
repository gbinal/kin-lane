    I am excited about the recent launch of Data.gov. I am very passionate about what API and open data access can do for companies and belive the same is true about Government. Now that the site is
    launched....we need some data. Doesn't look like much is available quite yet. I queried all categories and all agencies and got eight results. Its a start. I will be watching on a regular basis
    to see what data sets show up. Hopefully many more agencies see the value in posting their data online and involving the public at large.
