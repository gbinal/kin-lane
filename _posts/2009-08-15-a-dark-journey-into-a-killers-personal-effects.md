{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was listening to my NPR today and I just heard an episode called A Dark Journey Into A Killers Personal Effects.It is a thriller novel about a serial killer, however I find very interesting is the are creating what they call a multiplatform transmedia experience.They do this by extending the story beyond the book onto a web site, blog, offer phone numbers and much more material that extends the book into real life.I have talked about doing this before, I cant find the blog post right now.I think this is the future of TV and movies is to mimic more of the social and communication patterns we utilize every day.</p>
