{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wish Google would go ahead and make their move with Jotspot.  I have a Jotspot account, but I forget about it when using all my other Google Applications.<br /><br />Hopefully soon they get Jotspot integrated withe the rest of the Google Universe.<br /><br />A  Wiki environment will really tie everything together.</p>
