{% include JB/setup %}I wish Google would go ahead and make their move with Jotspot.  I have a Jotspot account, but I forget about it when using all my other Google Applications.Hopefully soon they get Jotspot integrated withe the rest of the Google Universe.A  Wiki environment will really tie everything together.
