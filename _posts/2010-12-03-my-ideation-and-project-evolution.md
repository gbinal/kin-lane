During my 20 years in the technology industry and many failed entrepreneurial endeavors I have gained some wisdom around managing my ideas and evolving them into projects.
Most of my startups and side-projects have gone nowhere. Have they failed? I think that is a matter of opinion. If you ask my ex-wife...she will say yes.
I say no. They were all learning experiences and evolved myself and my knowledge forward.
I have developed a method for recording my ideas using Evernote. I then high grade them based upon how much I think about them, evolve them and overall the potential of the idea.
High graded ideas end up on my personal project or production wiki @ Google Sites. I then flush these ideas out with outlines, research, code and data sample.
If a project they evolves much more and demands attention, I build a prototype. I keep things either on the side burner or back burner. I re-evaluate quarterly and will release some prototypes or ideas into the public domain if they go nowhere.
I figure it is best to set an idea free rather than think I own it in some way and never move it forward. Maybe my thoughts will help someone else working in a similar area. Or maybe the magic VC fairy will come along and give me 500 million dollars and say DO IT! I've heard stories!
Anyways, I am shutting down a couple Amazon EC2 instances and RDS deployments to save money around back burner projects. Projects I don't have time for. Here are three current projects:

	Google Reader Network
	Tech Job Analysis
	Tech Blogger Analysis

These are three ideas I am setting free. I want to share them with everyone, maybe generate some interest. At least just give them proper closure. I don't have time or $$ to move them forward. I am way to busy in the API space.
Let me know if you have any interest in them. Happy to geek out with you about them.
