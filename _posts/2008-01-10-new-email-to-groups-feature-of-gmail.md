Google quietly release another cool feature of Gmail today.  Now that we have groups under the Gmail contact manager, you can email to groups of contacts now instead of just to individual contacts.Seems they are really growing their contact manager system and introducing more of the relationship management features moving towards social network management.They continue bringing it together.
