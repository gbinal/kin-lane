    I just answered a question on LinkedIn...shortly thereafter I received a connection request from the QA thread. I happily accepted the connection request. As I was thanking the person I
    though...it would be real nice to have "notes" that store with each contact. This way I could jot down notes as I make connections or communicate with people that will give their relationship to
    me more context. These would be private notes, only available to me so I can understand why I made this connection. There are many contacts I have befriended that I either don't remember why I
    made the connection or would value the connection more if I remembered specific conversations with them.
