I have been going round and round with Amazon Web Services EC2 and Trend Micro MAPS for about 2 weeks now about the entire Amazon IP address block being black listed.
Finally got some action out of Amazon. They are going to add PTR records for all of the Amazon EC2 IP addresses that we lease.
Great news for legitimizing my usage of Amazon Web Services EC2 for our email infrastructure.
I'll write more about this later.
