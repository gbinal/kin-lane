I have been going round and round with Amazon Web Services EC2 and Trend Micro MAPS for about 2 weeks now about the entire Amazon IP address block being black listed.

Finally got some action out of Amazon. They are going to add [PTR records for all of the Amazon EC2 IP addresses][1] that we lease.

Great news for legitimizing my usage of Amazon Web Services EC2 for our email infrastructure.

[I'll write more about this later.][1]
