    I have seen a lot of data trying support the class distinction between different users of online applications and services.Ive seen the comparison between Facebook users being more intelligent
    and affluent than MySpace Users.I also saw a post on Mashable that Gmail users have higher credit scores than Yahoo mail users.I have to wonder.does the data support this or does presenting the
    data create this?
