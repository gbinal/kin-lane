    I was talking with a friend of mine recently about his job search.We were talking about different ways employers ask you to demonstrate your skills while interviewing.Some make you take tests,
    some want code examples, and some just expect you to sell yourself.My number one way to demonstrate my skills is through my blog.It not only is a quick way to demonstrate my skills to prospective
    employers, it also attracts employers that I do not apply to.
