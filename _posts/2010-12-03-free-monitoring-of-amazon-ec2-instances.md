    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_self">Amazon CloudWatch</a> has matured and now is available with a Freemium tier for monitoring your EC2 instance at no charge. <img src=
    "http://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/cw_ec2_metrics.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Amazon Cloudwatch allows you to monitor:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>CPU Load
      </li>
      <li>Disk Input / Ouput
      </li>
      <li>Network Input / Output
      </li>
    </ul>For your Amazon EC2 instances. The data is collected every five minutes and stored for two weeks. In true essence of a Freemium model you can then upgrade to a more detailed monitoring for
    .0015 / per hour per instance. If you are looking to take advantage of truly auto-scaling your Amazon EC2 infrastructure you need to start getting familiar with how Amazon CloudWatch works
