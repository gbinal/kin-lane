[Amazon CloudWatch][1] has matured and now is available with a Freemium tier for monitoring your EC2 instance at no charge. <img src="http://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/cw_ec2_metrics.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Amazon Cloudwatch allows you to monitor:

  * CPU Load
  * Disk Input / Ouput
  * Network Input / Output
For your Amazon EC2 instances. The data is collected every five minutes and stored for two weeks.

In true essence of a Freemium model you can then upgrade to a more detailed monitoring for .0015 / per hour per instance.

If you are looking to take advantage of truly auto-scaling your Amazon EC2 infrastructure you need to start getting familiar with how Amazon CloudWatch works
