{% include JB/setup %}Many businesses are growing into the clouds, but there are still are many on the fence. Before a business moves their entire small business setup to the Amazon cloud, they might consider using Amazon S3 just for backup and recovery.
A quick way to put the cloud to work for your small business, is to start backing up your data to Amazon S3. There are two great tools for backing up to the clouds off servers and workstations:

	Zmanda Cloud Backup
	Jungle Disk

I use automated tools to backup data from my:

	Workstations
	Servers 

I've been backing up to the Amazon S3 cloud since 2007 and haven't lost a single bucket, object or file . Files backed up on my Amazon S3 have saved my ass in many times when servers fail or data is lost.
