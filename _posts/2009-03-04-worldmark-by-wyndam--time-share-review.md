    In the last year or so of my marriage I signed up for Trendswest vacation resort.We went to their resort in St George Utah and went Zion and Bryce canyon.It was nice.Then Trendswest got bought by
    Worldmark.I have never been good at taking vacations so I thought this would be a great way to force myself into taking vacations around some beautiful places.
