{% include JB/setup %}<p>Last week during the&nbsp;Hackathon for Social Good in New York City, I was fortunate enough to be connected with Faye Anderson (@andersonatlarge) of the&nbsp;Cost of Freedom Project.&nbsp;The Hackathon for Social Good was put on my&nbsp;WebVisions, using the hackathon model to further projects that are making a social impact in our lives.The Cost of Freedom Project is centered around providing the necessary information and resources needed by U.S citizens to be able to vote in the 2012 elections, primarily targeted the 5 states that have strict laws requiring voters to show a government issued photo ID in order to vote.When it comes to making a social impact, Faye&rsquo;s project is a shining example, and I couldn&rsquo;t ignore her need for a hacker to move her project forward.</p>
