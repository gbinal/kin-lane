Google has increased the file size limit of files stored in Google Docs, from 1GB to 10GB.

This increase, along with them [opening up Google Docs to any file type,][1] really establishes the platform as a viable cloud storage solution.

I did not encounter too many files that were to large, but when working with print files and high resolution images, sometimes I would exceed the limit.

To recap, heere are some of the key things I use Google Docs for now:

  * [Word and Powerpoint File to PDF Conversion][2]
  * [Document Language Translation][3]
  * [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)][4]
  * [Resumable Upload][5]
  * [Secure Printing][6]
I use Google Docs as a [commercial document cloud printing platform][7], for managing several kind of document printing:

  * [Printing Single Sheets][8]
  * [Printing Bound Documents][9]
  * [Print Driver][10]
Now there are still [upload limits for Google Docs and Presentations][11], and this also applies when you are converting them.

However when it comes to storing PDF for publishing and printing, you can now store files that are up to 10GB using your Google Docs account.
