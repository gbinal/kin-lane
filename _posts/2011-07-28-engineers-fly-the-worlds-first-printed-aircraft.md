{% include JB/setup %}<p>Engineers from the University of Southampton, in the UK, have designed and flown the worlds first 3D printed aircraft.The plane is an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) whose entire structure has been printed, including wings, integral control surfaces and access hatches.It was printed on an EOS EOSINT P730 nylon laser sintering machine, which fabricates plastic or metal objects, building up the item layer by layer.The unmanned aircraft was designed with no fasteners, all equipment was attached using snap fit techniques so that the entire aircraft can be put together without tools in minutes.The aircraft is electric power and has a 2-metres wingspan, with a top speed of nearly 100 miles per hour, and is almost silent when in cruise mode.</p>
