    Im launching a new Amazon EC2 instance.Its running Windows + PHP + MySQL.Its a preset up instance AMI I have for harvesting data.Its setup with necessary harvest scripts with all my libraries
    setup just for pulling RSS, XML, and scraping HTML pages.Im doing some research about how to grow my Google Reader network based upon users who read and liked other posts that I liked.
