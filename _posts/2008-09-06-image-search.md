<p>
     When is image search going to move past what the picture is named and more about what the picture is about.
     <br />
     <br />
     If the picture author named the picture appropriately then the picture search is valid...however most of the time the results are crap.
     <br />
     <br />
     Makes it very frustrating to search for relative pictures.
