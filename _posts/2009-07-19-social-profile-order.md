    For some reason I happen to go to my Twitter profile today.I almost never pay attention to my Twitter stream.I have moments where I pay attention using twhirl, but for the most part I just
    broadcast to it without paying much attention.So anyways I went to my profile today.saw I rolled over 1000 followers while I havent been paying attention.
