    "http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> pulled its free version of its IPhone app from the Apple App Store over a month ago...and well, sales of the paid app are fine. <a title="Marco Arment"
    href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment">Marco Arment</a>, creator of Instapaper just tweeted:
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <em>"<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment/status/63010410286166016">As an experiment, I temporarily pulled the Free app from the App Store over a month ago. Sales of the paid app remain
      great. Few complaints.</a>"</em> What I like most about Arment and Instaper is he experiments with different monetization strategies for his app and API, and shares his thoughts and reasoning
      with the rest of the world.
    </p>I think sharing the stories, as we are all figuring this out is important for the industry as a whole, and it is great marketing. Arment says it's not just about the money, it's about the
    product. And he'll blog in detail about it soon. &nbsp; &nbsp;
