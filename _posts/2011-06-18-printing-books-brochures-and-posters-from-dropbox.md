[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-storage/dropbox-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />][1][Dropbox][1] is a dead simple, web-based file hosting service, that uses cloud computing to enable users to store and share files with others across the Internet using file synchronization.

Dropbox is a perfect platform for printing from. You can store all your PDF print files on Dropbox, and print with [Mimeo Connect][2].

So I threw together a couple of PHP script to show how to print a couple of common documents from Dropbox, and have delivered to your business the next day.

  * [Self-Publishing Flyers and Brochures Using Dropbox][4]
  * [Self-Publishing Posters Using Dropbox][5]
These samples are meant to show how to integrate commercial printing using Dropbox, into any web or mobile applicaiton.

All samples contain code samples you can download on [Github][6], or the [Mimeo Connect code library][7].
