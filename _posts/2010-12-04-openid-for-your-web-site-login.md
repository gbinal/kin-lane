    OpenID has become the standard for web site login, taking the authentication off your site and centralizing it using OpenID enabled accounts they use every day.OpenID makes it easier for users to
    login to your web site.Local account registration and login probably wont go away for some time, but login using OpenID providers such as Google and Twitter will dominate.Google has a sample site
    that shows how a website can migrate users away from local logins, and have them leverage a centralized identity provider.The sample site provides common examples of OpenID registration and login
    in a very familiar product driven web site.
