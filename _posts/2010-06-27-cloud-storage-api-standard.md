{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reviewing a cloud backup product, CloudBerry Backup yesterday.Each time I try a new cloud storage product I cant help think how we need interroperability between all the cloud storage providers.I would like to see a single client that could work with different cloud storage providers.Andy from Cloudberry points out this is difficult because of different approaches to cloud storage and the way their APIs work.A standard for cloud storage is needed.</p>
