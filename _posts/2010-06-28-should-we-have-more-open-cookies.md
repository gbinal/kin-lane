<img class="alignnone c1" title="Cookie Monster" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cookie-monster.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Cookies store information about us and our surfing habits (and they are yummy). One of the secure things about a cookie is that you can only access it within the web site to which the cookie belongs.

So if you are visiting [www.kinlane.com][1] I can put a cookie on your computer, but only I can access it. I own the domain [www.kinlane.com][1]

I just watched a movie on a famous band on [Netflix][2]. After watching I went to [Youtube][3] to look up more videos on this band.

Before I could watch my video on [Youtube][4], I had to watch an advertisement trying to sell me [Netflix][2].

It seems like we should have a "header" or part of a cookie that any domain can read. So youtube.com could query netflix.com on my computer and see if I'm a Netflix member, or at the very least see I just came from Netflix.

Just a thought.
