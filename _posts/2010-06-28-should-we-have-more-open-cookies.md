    information about us and our surfing habits (and they are yummy). One of the secure things about a cookie is that you can only access it within the web site to which the cookie belongs. So if you
    are visiting <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">www.kinlane.com</a> I can put a cookie on your computer, but only I can access it. I own the domain <a href=
    "http://www.kinlane.com">www.kinlane.com</a> I just watched a movie on a famous band on <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>. After watching I went to <a href=
    "http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> to look up more videos on this band. Before I could watch my video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, I had to watch an advertisement trying to
    sell me <a href="http://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>. It seems like we should have a "header" or part of a cookie that any domain can read. So youtube.com could query netflix.com
    on my computer and see if I'm a Netflix member, or at the very least see I just came from Netflix. Just a thought.
