    Been pissed off for a couple days because my new browser tab in Firefox doesnt fit up there anymore because of some new search box.Havent had time to figure out why.but keep fumbling because I
    cant add tab and have to use file menu.Then I noticed the keyboard shortcut for it.and I found its actually faster and Im training myself to use.
