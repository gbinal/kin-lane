{% include JB/setup %}It came up in a conversation today so I thought I would discuss it more. I know I've talked about a Universal Presence before, I'll provide some links later.
What I mean by a universal presence is moving beyond an obsession with just your web site and google search results.
In short you need to pay attention your Facebook profile just as much as you do your web site. All I am saying is a healthy Social Network and Social Media presense will soon deliver a better quality realationship than your web site can deliver alone.
These should all be tools in your toolbox:

	Web Site
	Blog
	Facebook Profile
	LinkedInProfile
	Twtter Account
	YouTube Channel
	Flickr Profile

You should put an equal amount of energy into each of these areas. Come up with creative ways of providing content and engaging your customers.
This is just a start. There are many ways to engage social media at:

	Forums
	QA Sites
	Wikis
	File Sharing Sites
	Company Profile Sites

And much much more. I just had to get this down as a starter and will elaborate soon.
