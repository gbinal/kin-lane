    It came up in a conversation today so I thought I would discuss it more.I know Ive talked about a Universal Presence before, Ill provide some links later.What I mean by a universal presence is
    moving beyond an obsession with just your web site and google search results.In short you need to pay attention your Facebook profile just as much as you do your web site.All I am saying is a
    healthy Social Network and Social Media presense will soon deliver a better quality realationship than your web site can deliver alone.
