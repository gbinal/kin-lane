    I keep talking about how cloud computing is changing IT, and IT managers need to pay attention.I just finished reading a blog that reminds me that project managers need to think about Cloud
    Computing as well.It talks about several key points project managers should consider: Moving Activities Upstream - Some items that usually occur downstream, once a project is in motion need to be
    addressed as part of the planning.Dealing with New Risks - Be aware of common risks with cloud computing, and be prepared for new ones at any moment.Cloud Computing Projects Will Be Different -
    Cloud computing is a different paradigm, even though it accomplishes many common business goals, but it is a new way of thinking.
