    I have used Google Chrome for the last few days, and I am happy with it. I still definitely can't live without my Firefox and its Add-Ons. However as a browser Google Chrome is very smooth and
    functional...I like it...it is an excellent start.<br />
    <br />
    I added to my desktop shortcuts right next to Internet Explorer and Firefox.<br />
    <br />
    I tend to use Firefox heavily for <a href="http://www.socialmediasquad.com">social media marketing campaign execution</a> because of the add-ons and Google Platform integration, however I now
    have Google Chrome open instead of Internet Explorer to have my personal mail and other applications available.<br />
    <br />
    I can definitely see where they are going with their platform direction. I will be setting up computers that I get for free and donate to non-profits and kids with Google OS and Google
    Chrome.....it is a great base.
