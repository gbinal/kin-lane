I have used Google Chrome for the last few days, and I am happy with it. I still definitely can't live without my Firefox and its Add-Ons. However as a browser Google Chrome is very smooth and functional...I like it...it is an excellent start.

I added to my desktop shortcuts right next to Internet Explorer and Firefox.

I tend to use Firefox heavily for [social media marketing campaign execution][1] because of the add-ons and Google Platform integration, however I now have Google Chrome open instead of Internet Explorer to have my personal mail and other applications available.

I can definitely see where they are going with their platform direction. I will be setting up computers that I get for free and donate to non-profits and kids with Google OS and Google Chrome.....it is a great base.
