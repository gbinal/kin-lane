    I really like Google approach to extending their applications beyond their core features and encouraging research and development by the masses.I was just reading a post on the Official Gmail
    Blog: Gmail Greasemonkey API issue.They outline how they have updated Gmail Javascript to load in an iframe.They talk about how this change may create some side effects in how some scripts
    work.They fully embrace the fact that Greasemonkey is a widely adopted method of extending applications, including most of the core Google Platform Applications.
