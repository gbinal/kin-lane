    I was helping someone choose a blogging platform today and they sent me a link for a possible choice.It was Squarespace.At first I thought, This isnt a quick and dirty FREE blogging platform.I
    left the tab open and quickly setup a Wordpress blog for them.I came back to the Squarespace site and went through their product tour.
