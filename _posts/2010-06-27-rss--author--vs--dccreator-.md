    I am always willing to admit when Im wrong.I was just railing on a site for not providing &lt;author&gt; information in their RSS feed.Im used to pulling the author name using the &lt;author&gt;
    tag.I come to learn that &lt;author&gt; tag is just meant for the post authors email address.&lt;dc:creator&gt; is truly meant for the name of the author.
