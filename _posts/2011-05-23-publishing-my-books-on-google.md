    Ive started exploring Google Books as a publishing platform for my books.I write my own books, but I want to explore what it looks like to be a publisher using Google Books and Mimeo Connect
    Cloud Print.As a publisher, Google Book allows me to: Increase awareness of my book titles Publish and promote at no cost Reach Googles worldwide user base Refer qualified traffic to my website
    Help Users Find Your Books First I will be uploading my titles to Google Books as PDF, then by matching the content in my book with user searches, Google Books will connects my titles books with
    the users who are most interested in buying them.Each Google Books result will display the books title and author, a short excerpt containing the highlighted search terms, and other public data
    about the book.When a user clicks on one of my your book titles from a search results page, it takes users to a limited preview of the title - just enough to give them a taste of the book, as if
    they were browsing in a bookstore or library.
