{% include JB/setup %}<p>SPAM black lists come in very handy for filtering out servers that potentially are sending SPAM.However every once in a while I get a server listed and I get stuck in hell.Our primary mail server got black listed yesterday at some point, and it happens to be a black list that SAP references.So of course no emails will go to our biggest client.I requested with Trend Micro MAPS to have us removed yesterday at 5:00 PM.</p>
