The future is cloudy and accessed through mobile platforms according to the [Future of the Internet, Cloud Computing][1] report by the Pew Internet and American Life Project.<img class="alignnone c1" title="Imagining the Internet" src="http://www.elon.edu/predictions/images/pew.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />

I agree with most of the findings there, I think it will roll out a little differently than anticipated by most, and take longer.

I think many companies are jumping on the Iphone and Android mobile application bandwagon, even before asking themselves if there own web site is mobile ready.

Is your web site friendly to mobile web surfers? If I click on a link from an email I get from you, end up at your web site on my Iphone, can I navigate around?

I know many of the leading edge clients I work with, mobile browsing is not even on the radar.

Mobile computing is the future, start with the basics. Get your web site mobile ready.
