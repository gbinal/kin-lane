    Google Apps provides a very powerful document management solution, Google Docs.With Google Docs you can upload and create many different types of documents.The Google Apps platform also allows
    users to collaborate, share, translate, download and print documents in Google Apps.This is pretty powerful stuff, when it comes to business publishing and printing.A couple months ago I built a
    prototype of a commercial print application using Google Cloud Print.
