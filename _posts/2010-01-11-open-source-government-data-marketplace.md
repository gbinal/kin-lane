Someone needs to create an open source version of [data.gov][1].

Every city, county and state municipalities need a copy. There needs to be a well written, secure and standards based open source version available.

It would be setup identical with:

  * RAW Data Catalog with XML, CSV, KML, etc data files
  * Tool Catalog or Marketplace
  * GeoData Catalog
It would also give all the links to integrate and share data with other government entities.

It would have an FAQ, Share Tools, Blog , etc.

It wouldn't be that difficult to develope. Would just need the right specifications and team behind it to make sure it is written securely.
