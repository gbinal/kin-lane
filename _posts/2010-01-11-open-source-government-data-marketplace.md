{% include JB/setup %}<p>Someone needs to create an open source version of data.gov.Every city, county and state municipalities need a copy.There needs to be a well written, secure and standards based open source version available.It would be setup identical with:

	RAW Data Catalog with XML, CSV, KML, etc data files
	Tool Catalog or Marketplace
	GeoData Catalog

It would also give all the links to integrate and share data with other government entities.</p>
