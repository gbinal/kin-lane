{% include JB/setup %}
<p>
     Someone needs to create an open source version of <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>. Every city, county and state municipalities need a copy. There needs to be a well written, secure and standards based open source version available. It would be setup identical with:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>RAW Data Catalog with XML, CSV, KML, etc data files
     </li>
     <li>Tool Catalog or Marketplace
     </li>
     <li>GeoData Catalog
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     It would also give all the links to integrate and share data with other government entities. It would have an FAQ, Share Tools, Blog , etc. It wouldn't be that difficult to develope. Would just need the right specifications and team behind it to make sure it is written securely.
