I'm publishing some recent work I've been doing with the cloud storage platform [Box.net][2].

Box.net provides enterprise class, cloud storage services, and their developer program and the OpenBox platform makes it easy to integrate commercial printing services with [Mimeo.com][3].

I've finished three working examples for printing from Box.net:

  * **[Single Sheet Printer][4]** \- Allows printing of brochures, flyers, and other single page documents.
  * **[Bound Document Printer][5]** \- Allows printing of books, magazines, newsletters, and other bound documents.
  * **[Print File Manager][6]** \- Allows management of print files with Box.net and migrating these to Mimeo.com for printing.

Managing print files in the cloud with Box.net makes sense. They provide some pretty amazing web-based and mobile tools for business to manage documents in the cloud.

With their self-service application development environment anyone can easily integrate the cloud storage platform with [Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API][8].

These samples introduce the concepts of printing from Box.net, there are plenty of other scenarios where developers could deploy applications that generate revenue from cloud printing services.
