    I am constantly looking for better tools to manage my cloud environments.I have been using Amazon S3 since it first came out.I really saw the potential Amazon S3 had early on, as storage for all
    my web applications.I ran a web application development company with my now ex-wife for eight years called Original Web Solutions.We were on version 4.
