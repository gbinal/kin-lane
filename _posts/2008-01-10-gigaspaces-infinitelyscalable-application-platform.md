    Was introduced to GigaSpaces today by a friend at the University of Oregon.What an amazing application platform.It truly an infinite scaling application that just doesnt handle the back-end tier,
    it tackles the business layer as well.This is similar to the technology that Google and Amazon have built for themselves and their offerings.They also have an GigaSpaces Amazon Machine Image
    (AMI) that is publicly available, and there is a white paper available for the GigaSpaces EC2 Machine Image.
