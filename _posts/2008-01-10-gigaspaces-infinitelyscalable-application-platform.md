Was introduced to GigaSpaces today by a friend at the University of Oregon. What an amazing application platform. It truly an infinite scaling application that just doesn't handle the back-end tier, it tackles the business layer as well.

This is similar to the technology that Google and Amazon have built for themselves and their offerings.

They also have an [GigaSpaces Amazon Machine Image (AMI)][1] that is publicly available, and there is a [white paper available for the GigaSpaces EC2 Machine Image][1].

Gigaspaces support for Java, .Net (C#), and C . They are also working on a presentation layer that works with the likes of Flash / Flex, AJAX, and Microsoft Silverlight.

They are reworking their pricing right now, however their target audience is the small business and startups so it should be affordable. They also have a [community version available of Gigaspaces][2].

I am going to do a little more homework here.
