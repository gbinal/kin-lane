    I just finished a big migration to Amazon Web Services for my company.I am using Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 mainly for everything.We are pushing the futurue of scaling for an event, conference, or
    tradeshow and the strategy and marketing that goes with it.I am primarily using Amazon Ec2 for the base technology platform and using Amazon S3 for backup of server images, server data, and
    personal user workstation backups.I am not using Amazon S3 as fully as I would like to.
