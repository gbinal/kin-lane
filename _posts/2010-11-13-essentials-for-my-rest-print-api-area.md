I have established the phase one for my Mimeo Connect REST Print API. I need just the essentials to get the API up and running.

I am focusing on providing just the following API building blocks:

  * **Dashboard** \- Basic API area dashboard with essential links and information.
  * **Registration** \- Allow developers to register with the live and sandbox Mimeo environments.
  * **Account Management** \- Allow developers to manage the details of their accounts.
  * **Overview** \- Overview of the Mimeo web tools and REST Print API.
  * **Getting Started** \- A getting started guide providing developers with exactly what they need to get going.
  * **REST API Documentation** \- General API document for all API services and end points.
  * **JS / JQuery Examples** \- Simple JavaScript samples using the JQuery library.
  * **P****HP Samples** \- Simple PHP samples using the PEAR library.
  * **Sandbox** \- Developer sandbox for developers to write code against and test applications.
These nine building blocks I feel are the bare minimum for any API area deployment. I call this an API area because it is a simple dashboard, registration and tools to begin integration. There is no community or living [API ecosystem][1] yet. I have a long way to go before that.

Even though I am putting together all the content for my REST API area I have not decided whether I will build or buy this platform. I am still discussing my goals with [Mashery][2], [3Scale][3] and [Apigee][4]. Once I get quotes from them I will make a decision on which path I will choose.

Regardless of whether I build or buy my API area these are the essential building blocks I need to open my API up for business.
