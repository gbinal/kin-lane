{% include JB/setup %}<p>As Im preparing to launch my new Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API area, Im taking inventory of my ecosystem.Granted, its not a true ecosystem yet.I call it that, because I hope my efforts will yield a self-sustaining cloud printing API ecosystem.Mimeo ecosystem areas are:

	Mimeo
	My Mimeo
	Mimeo Marketplace
	Mimeo Lounge 
	Knowledge Base

Mimeo Connect ecosystem consists of:

	Mimeo Connect Overview
	Developer Area (Not updated with my new area yet)
	My Mimeo Sandbox

External ecosystem consists of:

	Twitter
	LinkedIn
	Github
	Google Code (many projects, dont have single profile like Github)
	Stack Exchange

Im just getting going on all of my Mimeo Connect and external ecosystem pieces, so until I launch my new area they are limited in information.This is just the version 1.</p>
