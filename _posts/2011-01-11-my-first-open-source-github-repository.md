I have checked out and downloaded code from plenty of [github][1] repositories. I've even help manage a couple of private repositories for clients. [<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1] I have never actually shared an open source repository before. A virgin of sorts.

I posted the [Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API PHP REST Client][2] today. It is a simple PHP Class for consuming the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print REST API.

It the [PEAR Request2 librar][3]y to make REST calls against any of the REST service endpoints.

It is the first of hopefully many code libraries and applications I will be open sourcing and publishing to [github][1].
