In my theme of doing one thing and doing it well....I am going to start proposing business ideas that I either come across or come up with myself.
Here is an idea that would do well, maybe its already out there...I haven't had time to do due diligence.
Contact Sync Tool.
Now I know this exists in several formats, between Outlook and Google, etc. I am talking about a SaaS that this is all they do. They sync up between all known major and minor systems.
I have seen people asking of sync between LinkedIn and Facebook, and Facebook and their CRM.
Seems like someone who focused on exclusively doing this could do it well...and charge a simple fee to access each account. If a company just focused on this and didn't do it in a selfish or proprietary manner it would be a great selling service.
