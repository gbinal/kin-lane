    As technology rolls forward, there are many new concepts, but sometimes things we know from the past can also be reborn.A new concept IPhone case from Mac Funamizu prints photos just like a
    Poloraoid.Using a QR code and geo tagged map the printed picture can also be linked to a digital version on the web.A ery intriguing concept that merges new and old into a very usable piece of
    technology.
