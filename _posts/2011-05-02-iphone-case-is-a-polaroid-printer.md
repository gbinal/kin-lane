     As technology rolls forward, there are many new concepts, but sometimes things we know from the past can also be reborn. A new concept IPhone case from Mac Funamizu prints photos just like a Poloraoid. Using a QR code and geo tagged map the printed picture can also be linked to a digital version on the web. A ery intriguing concept that merges new and old into a very usable piece of technology.
