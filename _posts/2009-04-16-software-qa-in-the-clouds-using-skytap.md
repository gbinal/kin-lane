{% include JB/setup %}<p>So I have been test driving a new cloud platform or tool every couple days as I have time.I took a test drive and demo of SkyTap last week.I wrote down some notes on it, but will be processing what I saw for some time.It is a very innovative platform that allows you to deploy Infrastructure as a Service for prototyping, test, and laboratory environments.One use I saw for it was Software QA for either desktop or web applications.</p>
