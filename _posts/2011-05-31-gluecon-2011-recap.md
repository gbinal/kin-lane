{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wanted to take some time and recap my thoughts from the 2011 Glue Conference.A lot happened last week, but I wanted to highlight some of the sessions and discussions that really stuck with me.First, it was one of the best events Ive been to in a while.The event is about everything I focus on in my career:  web applications, APIs, data, and open-source.To the kick off, I recall Laura Merling of Alcatel-Lucent focusing on video, mobile and the huge potential within emerging markets in her Flipping the Bird(s) on the Traditional Data Model talk.</p>
