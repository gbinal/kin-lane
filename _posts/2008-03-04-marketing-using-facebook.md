    Was just reading <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2008/03/03/facebook-marketing-opportunties/">Facebook Marketing Opportunities</a> over at <u><span style=

    <br />
    I am currently playing around with several strategies for marketing our companies products on Facebook.<br />
    <br />
    His statement about 8 ways to market on Facebook really stood out, and I have seen reciprocated on several other core marketing blogs:<br />
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Application Development
      </li>
      <li>Group Participation
      </li>
      <li>Paid Groups
      </li>
      <li>Targete Ads
      </li>
      <li>Newsfeed Advertising
      </li>
      <li>Beacon Advertising
      </li>
      <li>Guerrilla Individual Targeting
      </li>
    </ul>I am also exploring other methods for targeting around social graph marketing to specific measured social graphs for a focused but broad reach.
