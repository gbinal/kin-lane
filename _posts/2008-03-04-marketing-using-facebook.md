Was just reading [Facebook Marketing Opportunities][1] over at Digital Podcast.

I am currently playing around with several strategies for marketing our companies products on Facebook.

His statement about 8 ways to market on Facebook really stood out, and I have seen reciprocated on several other core marketing blogs:


  * Application Development
  * Group Participation
  * Paid Groups
  * Targete Ads
  * Newsfeed Advertising
  * Beacon Advertising
  * Guerrilla Individual Targeting
I am also exploring other methods for targeting around social graph marketing to specific measured social graphs for a focused but broad reach.
