I was looking for a quick way to get our [Social Media Squad][1] blog on the home page and feature area on our new Social Media Squad web site.

I wanted it to be a real-time feed, so I chose to go with a [JavaScript RSS Feed][2], and I quickly found [Feed2JS][2].

I was able to select:


  * URL of the RSS Feed
  * Number of items to display
  * Amount of RSS description to show
  * Show item posting date
  * Open links in a new window

I is nice to just find quality simple tools available out there in cyberspace that you can use to make your life easier...and get work done.
