{% include JB/setup %}<p>I made it over the last hurdle building my Google Cloud Print Proxy in PHP.I have a prototype for the Google Cloud Print, XMPP Print Job Notification Service.Even though you can pull print jobs via the GCP /fetch interface, Google requires cloud print proxies to receive print job notifications via an XMPP push, rather than constantly polling the /fetch interface.It make sense.Using XMPP is a great way to receive API notifications, and minimize requests to an API.</p>
