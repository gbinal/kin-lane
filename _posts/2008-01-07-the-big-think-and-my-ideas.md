{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just playing around with a site called the Big Think.  It is a Youtube for ideas.  Having various business, social, and whatever ideas flowing out constantly naturally I think this is a great idea!So I setup my profile and I am going to start putting my ideas in here and storing them.I decided long ago to stop keeping them in my notebook and start publishing them.  As I post them I will write a little blog entry about them and put it here.</p>
