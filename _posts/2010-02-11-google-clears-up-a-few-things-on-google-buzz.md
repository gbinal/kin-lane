     Google responded to everyone on the Gmail blog about some of the open questions around Google Buzz. They addressed some of the privacy concerns around your Google Contacts and how your Buzz network operates. They cover: More visible option to not show followers/people you follow on your public profile Ability to block anyone who starts following you More clarity on which of your followers/people you follow can appear on your public profile I like how they closed it: We designed Buzz to make it easy to connect with others and have conversations about things that interest you, and it's great to see millions of you doing this already. It's still early, and we have a long list of improvements on the way. We look forward to hearing more suggestions and will continue to improve the Buzz experience with user transparency and control top of mind. They say they are going to "improve the Buzz experience with user transparency and control top of mind". Have to think about that one. Transparency and privacy with Google Buzz will an interesting line to draw.
