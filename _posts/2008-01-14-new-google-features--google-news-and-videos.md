    It is fun finding new Google Features.I never really know when they come out, but when I find them they are new to me so I am blogging about them.I was reading Google News as I do daily and
    noticed a little + sign next to one of my Recommended for Kin Lane articles.So I click on it and I get a news video from Youtube related to the news article.Definitely blurring the lines between
    what I think of as traditional news journalism and new media.
