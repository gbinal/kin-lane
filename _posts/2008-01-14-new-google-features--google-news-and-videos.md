I never really know when they come out, but when I find them they are new to me so I am blogging about them.

I was reading Google News as I do daily and noticed a little sign next to one of my Recommended for Kin Lane articles.

So I click on it and I get a news video from Youtube related to the news article.

Definitely blurring the lines between what I think of as traditional news journalism and new media.[<img class="c1" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_9OGzs28s_k4/R4wuZ0gj36I/AAAAAAAAAuM/Mpj1fO4djjw/s320/Google+News+2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155546694559195042" border="0" />][2]

Definitely an important view of how important a Universal Online and Social Media Marketing Strategy can be.

The more content you have on a topic the more prominence and exposure you can get.

So when you publish an article, publish related photos, videos, and any other related content you can find.

All the players are really cross referencing everything.
