    So Google has release offline access for Google Calendar to all users. Now I have offline access enabled for my key Google Apps.
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Google Mail (Gmail)
      </li>
      <li>Google Docs
      </li>
      <li>Google Calendars
      </li>
      <li>Google Reader
      </li>
    </ul>This allows me to use all these applications while I am not connected to the Internet on the road or otherwise. It is pretty exciting because it makes my Google Office Suite much more like
    Microsoft Office. I think it is a huge step forward for running your office suite in the clouds!
