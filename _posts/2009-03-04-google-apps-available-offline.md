So Google has release offline access for Google Calendar to all users. Now I have offline access enabled for my key Google Apps.

	Google Mail (Gmail)
	Google Docs
	Google Calendars
	Google Reader

This allows me to use all these applications while I am not connected to the Internet on the road or otherwise. It is pretty exciting because it makes my Google Office Suite much more like Microsoft Office.
I think it is a huge step forward for running your office suite in the clouds!
