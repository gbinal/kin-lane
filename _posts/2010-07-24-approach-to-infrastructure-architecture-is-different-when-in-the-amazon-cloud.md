{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading Insights from the AWS Cloud Computing for the Enterprise Event in Los Angeles on the Morph blog.They offer some good morsels of cloud wisdom and have a good presentation by Dr.Werner Vogels.What stuck with me were the bullet points about designing infrastructure when using cloud based Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

	Design for flexibility
	Design for on-demand
	Design for automation
	Decompose into its simplest form
	Break transparency
	Design with security
	Dont do it alone
	Continuously innovate
	Let your customers benefit

When I hear about failed attempts at deploying cloud infrastructure, it generally showcases IT people getting frustrated because they are applying the same principles for architecture design they have been using for years.Many of the same concepts apply, but you have to evolve them to match how the cloud works.</p>
