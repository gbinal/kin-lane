I started doing some [research on cloud computing][1] a couple weeks ago. I have been watching the [Google][2] search results for my name to see how long it took for this research to float up in my profile.

It showed up at #28 now. I have seen other pages too show up below that.

I am interested in seeing how quickly you can launch a site using [Google sites][3] and have it indexed. I am using a sub domain off an existing domain. I link to this research from my blog regularly.

In addition to the general [cloud computing research][1], this project is an excercise to see what I can do using the Google Platform as a cloud environment as well.
