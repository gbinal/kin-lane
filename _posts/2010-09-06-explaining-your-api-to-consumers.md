The ability to explain your API to developers and potential consumers is critical to the success of your API Ecosystem. Whether its core API docs, samples, training materials or marketing materials your documentation needs to tell the story of your API and the business problems it solves.

<img class="alignnone c1" title="SDK Bridge" src="http://sdkbridge.com/images/ui/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I was just reviewing services offered by [SDK Bridge][1]. They had me with the bullets points of their services on their home page:

  * API Documentationï¿½both conceptual and reference
  * Sample code and tutorials
  * Highly technical copywriting
  * Training sessions on how to use software platforms
  * Technology classes for youth
  * We work remotely or on-site with your development team
Then they really drive it home by stating they are the **_bridge between people and technology_**. So very true.

Quality [documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface][1] (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor.

I'm adding [SDK Bridge][1] to my list of API service providers that can help you deliver a more comprehensive [API Ecosystem][2].
