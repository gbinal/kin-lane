    applications has become popular among the highly influential IPhone user base.Instagram allows you to take photos on your IPhone apply unique filters to them which change color, brightness,
    borders and create an entirely new version of your photo.The mobile app allows you to enhance the average photos taken with your IPhone and quickly share to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr or Tumblr.
