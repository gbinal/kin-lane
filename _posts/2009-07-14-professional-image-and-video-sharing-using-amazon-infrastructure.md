    I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across another cool service built on their infrastructure. It is called phanfare, a subscription-based photo and video
    sharing service for serious amateurs and pro photographers. I definitely feel that Amazon S3 is the best storage for your videos and photos. I store all my raw image, video and other files at
    Amazon S3. Then I secondarily keep them at the cloud application of my choice such as Flickr, Youtube or otherwise. I am going to take a test drive of this application as well, let you know how
    it works under the hood.
