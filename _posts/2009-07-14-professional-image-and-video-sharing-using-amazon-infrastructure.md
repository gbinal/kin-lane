{% include JB/setup %}I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across another cool service built on their infrastructure.
It is called phanfare, a subscription-based photo and video sharing service for serious amateurs and pro photographers.
I definitely feel that Amazon S3 is the best storage for your videos and photos. I store all my raw image, video and other files at Amazon S3. Then I secondarily keep them at the cloud application of my choice such as Flickr, Youtube or otherwise.
I am going to take a test drive of this application as well, let you know how it works under the hood.
