{% include JB/setup %}<p>As I am doing things every night.I am uploading files, downloading files, making database updates,  and bulk find / replaces I try to maintain my profile.Being in the social media business it seems I should have a more complete profile, at least on the major networks.It is a lot of work to maintain multiple social network profiles, keep track of blogs, images, videos, and all the other stuff.Think Ill hire someone to help me with my profile.</p>
