    As I am doing things every night...I am uploading files, downloading files, making database updates, and bulk find / replaces I try to maintain my profile.<br />
    <br />
    Being in the social media business it seems I should have a more complete profile, at least on the major networks.<br />
    <br />
    It is a lot of work to maintain multiple social network profiles, keep track of blogs, images, videos, and all the other stuff.<br />
    <br />
    Think I'll hire someone to help me with my profile.
