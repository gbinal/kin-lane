    Those of you know me, know that I'm an NPR junkie....I love the stories and music. I listen to the StoryCorp programs every week. Many touching stories.<br />
    <br />
    There was one today that really moved me:<br />

    It was a mom telling the story about how her 9 year old son died watching a sunset.<br />
    <br />
    WOW. That was moving.
