Those of you know me, know that I'm an NPR junkie....I love the stories and music.  I listen to the StoryCorp programs every week.  Many touching stories.There was one today that really moved me:http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90959458It was a mom telling the story about how her 9 year old son died watching  a sunset.WOW.  That was moving.
