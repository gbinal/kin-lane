Those of you know me, know that I'm an NPR junkie....I love the stories and music. I listen to the StoryCorp programs every week. Many touching stories.

There was one today that really moved me:

It was a mom telling the story about how her 9 year old son died watching a sunset.

WOW. That was moving.
