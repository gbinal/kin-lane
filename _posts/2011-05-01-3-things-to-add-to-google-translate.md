     <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a> is an amazing tool. It translates those random foreign web pages I run across, and those ever growing number of emails I receive from overseas.<a href="http://translate.google.com"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png"  align="right" /></a>

     I have 3 suggestions for Google to add:
</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Geek</strong> - Translate geek so I can talk about technical things to my mom.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Legaleze</strong> - Translate terms of service and other legal documents so I can make sense of them.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Transportation</strong> - Translate those people speaking over the loudspeakers at airports, train and bus stations so I can understand them.
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
     As you make Google Translate more useful for our everyday lives, I think these three additions would help immensly.
