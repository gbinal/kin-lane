    Google Translate is an amazing tool.It translates those random foreign web pages I run across, and those ever growing number of emails I receive from overseas.I have 3 suggestions for Google to
    add: Geek - Translate geek so I can talk about technical things to my mom.Legaleze - Translate terms of service and other legal documents so I can make sense of them.Transportation - Translate
    those people speaking over the loudspeakers at airports, train and bus stations so I can understand them.
