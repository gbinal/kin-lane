{% include JB/setup %}Google Translate is an amazing tool. It translates those random foreign web pages I run across, and those ever growing number of emails I receive from overseas.
I have 3 suggestions for Google to add:

	Geek - Translate geek so I can talk about technical things to my mom.
	Legaleze - Translate terms of service and other legal documents so I can make sense of them.
	Transportation - Translate those people speaking over the loudspeakers at airports, train and bus stations so I can understand them.

As you make Google Translate more useful for our everyday lives, I think these three additions would help immensly.
