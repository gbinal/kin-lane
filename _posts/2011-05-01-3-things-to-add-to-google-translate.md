[Google Translate][1] is an amazing tool. It translates those random foreign web pages I run across, and those ever growing number of emails I receive from overseas.[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-translate.png" alt="" align="right" />][1]

I have 3 suggestions for Google to add:

  1. **Geek** \- Translate geek so I can talk about technical things to my mom.
  2. **Legaleze** \- Translate terms of service and other legal documents so I can make sense of them.
  3. **Transportation** \- Translate those people speaking over the loudspeakers at airports, train and bus stations so I can understand them.
As you make Google Translate more useful for our everyday lives, I think these three additions would help immensly.
