    Starting to see some ad networks and ad models moving beyond traditional views or clicks. Videoegg launched a new <a href="http://www.videoegg.com/adframes">pay per engagement video
    model.</a><br />
    <br />
    Advertisers pay only on an "engagement" basis or when a user rolls over the ad and the advertisers full screen is displayed.<br />
    <br />
    It is a first for this type of true engagement model and really focuses your advertising.
