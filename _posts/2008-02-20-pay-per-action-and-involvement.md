Starting to see some ad networks and ad models moving beyond traditional views or clicks. Videoegg launched a new [pay per engagement video model.][1]

Advertisers pay only on an "engagement" basis or when a user rolls over the ad and the advertisers full screen is displayed.

It is a first for this type of true engagement model and really focuses your advertising.
