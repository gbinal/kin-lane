I went ahead and signed up for Bebo Social Network tonight. I was reading a blog post on Techcrunch called [Bebo's Platform Now Open for All Developers][1] and thought I should go ahead check it out for myself.

I belong to most of the major Social Networks now and was reading the other day on how [Bebo was named as best social networking site in a survey][2] and is beating out Facebook

It is a very clean application similar to Facebook. Which I like. That is one thing about MySpace that really bothers me is how it is so cluttered and just crappy looking.

I like the video, music and authors sections that really highlights the major aspects of our social worlds.

They don't have too many applications right now, I noticed one business application allowing you to podcast.

This gives me yet [another social network profile to manage][3], but hey it all increases my presence.

Will keep poking around and see what it has to offer.
