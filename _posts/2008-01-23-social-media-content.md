    I am stilling sifting through all the blogs I read and information I gather on a clear definition in my mind of what describes all the content I generate around the Internet.<br />
    <br />
    My <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_graph_concepts_and_issues.php">social graph</a> is a definition of my relationships and my communication with these people.<br />
    <br />
    I have been reading more on the <a href="http://technobabble2dot0.wordpress.com/2007/07/16/social-media-index/">social media index</a> and how you can rate someone using this methodology based
    upon several key areas:<br />
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Blogs
      </li>
      <li>Multi-Format
      </li>
      <li>Mini-Updates
      </li>
      <li>Business Cards
      </li>
      <li>Visual
      </li>
      <li>Favourites
      </li>
      <li>Flexible weighting<br />
      </li>
    </ul>However this addresses highly public organizations or people with distinct presence. I have a blog / site that I maintain, but I am no means Techcrunch.<br />
    <br />
    What sort of definition describes me and the content I publish all over the place at:<br />
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Social Networks
      </li>
      <li>Video Sharing Sites
      </li>
      <li>Image &amp; Picture Sharing Sites
      </li>
      <li>Social Bookmarking Sites
      </li>
      <li>And much more
      </li>
    </ul>What single definition describes my user generated content distributed all over the Internet?<br />
    <br />
    Once I can define I can continue to define a metric and ultimately a measurement of this presence.
