I am stilling sifting through all the blogs I read and information I gather on a clear definition in my mind of what describes all the content I generate around the Internet.

My [social graph][1] is a definition of my relationships and my communication with these people.

I have been reading more on the [social media index][2] and how you can rate someone using this methodology based upon several key areas:


  * Blogs
  * Multi-Format
  * Mini-Updates
  * Business Cards
  * Visual
  * Favourites
  * Flexible weighting

However this addresses highly public organizations or people with distinct presence. I have a blog / site that I maintain, but I am no means Techcrunch.

What sort of definition describes me and the content I publish all over the place at:


  * Social Networks
  * Video Sharing Sites
  * Image
