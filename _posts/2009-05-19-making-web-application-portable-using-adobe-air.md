I am enjoying taking a current web application and making it run in Adobe Air. So far I have quickly ported an existing ColdFusion web application over to run within a downloadable Adobe Air application.
It runs as it does in the browser with a few modifications.
It is completely dependent on an internet connection. Next I will be playing with the underlying data model and see what I can as far as replicating its database locally and run off a local database and sync with live when an Internet connection is available.
Fun stuff, I could see a lot of potential here for taking existing apps and making portable versions, or online product catalogs and making them run independently of their public web site.
More to come on this topic as I work to migrate various WEG Applications.
