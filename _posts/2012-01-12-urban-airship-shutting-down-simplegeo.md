{% include JB/setup %}<p>Just three months after&nbsp;Urban Airship&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;SimpleGeo, they are&nbsp;shutting down the places, context and storage service.Urban Airship is merging SimpleGeo services into their mobile customer engagement solution to offer location and context-based services as part of the package.Users of Urban Airship will be able to take advantage of location and context to better segment and engage their mobile audience by sending push notifications to users based upon specific device types, geographical regions and during specific time frames.To be able to deliver this new functionality they are going to shut down the current versions of SimpleGeo Places, Context and Storage by March 31st, 2012.Urban Airship is redirecting their places data customers to&nbsp;Factual&nbsp;to get the local data they need, and also have an additional list of replacement services for context and storage on their support site.</p>
