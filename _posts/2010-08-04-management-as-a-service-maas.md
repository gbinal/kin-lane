    I have been reviewing as many Cloud Service providers as I can get my hands on.I am building a database right now of them and their products, locations, and types of providers.I am breaking them
    into the following types: Software as a Service (SaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Open Source Enterprise Education Government Cloud service providers usually
    fit neatly into one or many of those categorizations without a problem.Except for one group; the growing number of cloud management software providers.There are some that have their own data
    centers or platforms so they easily fit into a category.
