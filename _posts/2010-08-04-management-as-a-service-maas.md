{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been reviewing as many Cloud Service providers as I can get my hands on.I am building a database right now of them and their products, locations, and types of providers.I am breaking them into the following types:

	Software as a Service (SaaS)
	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
	Open Source
	Enterprise
	Education
	Government

Cloud service providers usually fit neatly into one or many of those categorizations without a problem.Except for one group; the growing number of cloud management software providers.There are some that have their own data centers or platforms so they easily fit into a category.</p>
