    I was browsing the magazine rack at borders books this morning as I often do.I notice an IPhone Application directory magazine.Besides the fact that Mac and I everything seems to dominate the
    technology section of the magazine rack, Apple really is on it when it comes to publishing.I would like to see a Blackberry, Android, and other smart phone application directory or overview
    publication.I think this would be one more step towards the other handheld platforms competing against IPhone.
