    I was browsing the magazine rack at borders books this morning as I often do. I notice an IPhone Application directory magazine. Besides the fact that Mac and I everything seems to dominate the
    technology section of the magazine rack, Apple really is on it when it comes to publishing. I would like to see a Blackberry, Android, and other smart phone application directory or overview
    publication. I think this would be one more step towards the other handheld platforms competing against IPhone. Just a suggestion guys. Not that I am against IPhone, I am just advocating for the
    competition and well the phones I posess. I have 2 blackberries and an Android phone. I will swap out one of my blackberries for an IPhone soon enough.
