    Working with my current company I really notice you can use Google Docs and Office Docs that are setup and circulated regularly are a good indicator of potential systems that need developed or
    possible 3rd party systems that need researched.When you see a spreadsheet that is commonly used or passed around it may signal a need for new feature in existing system or a completely new
    system.A spreadsheet or other office document can really be a basic prototyping process of new systems and how users need or will adopt the new tools.It is a low cost way to immediately start
    getting the job done and in the language users understand.Everyone knows how to use a spreadsheet right?
