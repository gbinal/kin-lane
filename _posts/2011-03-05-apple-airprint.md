[Apple AirPrint][1] enables printing on Apple products to HP printers over a wireless network.

Airprint enables printing without installing drivers or configuring a printer queue.

Apple products that support AirPrint are:

  * iPad (running iOS 4.2 or later)
  * iPod Touch (running iOS 4.2 or later)
  * iPhone (running iOS 4.2 or later)

Airprint only supports printing to [HP web connected printers][2] currently.

All printers must be connected to the same network as your Airprint enabled device.
