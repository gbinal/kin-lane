{% include JB/setup %}<p>I had a discussion yesterday with Audrey Wattersabout the infamous junk drawer(s) that exists in every house.That end of the counter drawer that seems to accumulate everything from around our house that we think we may some day use.Junk drawers possess those small items that hold our lives together.Nuts, bolts, fasteners, knobs, hinges and handles as well as the tools we use to assemble the futon, bikes, shelves and other household appliances.We keep all these items because we dont want to throw them away.</p>
