    I have been getting happier with the contact management tools available in Gmail.and some of the integration with other Google Applications.I would like to see more social networking and social
    graph management tools, like their recent social graph api release.Now Google has added another simple, yet powerful tool to their API arsenal.A common contact list has helped power applications
    like Gmail, Google Reader, and Google Calendar, and with the launch of the Google Contacts Data API, you can access this list with other external applications.
