<img src="http://photoduino.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/_img/en/introduction.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />**[Photoduino][1]**is an open source camera controller based on the**[Arduino platform][2]**.

It is designed to take photographs using various techniques such as time-lapses, high speed photography, photography of animals, and storms photography.

The electronic circuit is capable to control autofocus and shutter of a camera and two separate manuals flashes. It also has a sound sensor, an impact/shock sensor, a laser barrier and an infrared barrier that can be used to take pictures when an event is registered.

The system is currently compatible with[multitude of cameras][3]but may be adaptable in the future to other models and brands that have remote shutter connector cable.

Both the hardware as their firmware are completely free and open and are published under[GPLv3][4], just as the**Arduino platform**in which it is based.
