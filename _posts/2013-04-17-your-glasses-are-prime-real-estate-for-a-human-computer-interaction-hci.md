    I’m closely following the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) world lately, in an attempt to understand the role APIs will play in this expanding tech sector.One product that is of particular
    interest is Google Glasses, which I think is one of the most exciting and scariest technologies to emerge in recent times.As I look across the landscape of emerging HCI technology and other more
    known and adopted technologies such as smart phones, GPS, etc, I can’t help but think about how Google is genius for targeting the most ideal real estate in our physical world.Think about the
    other pieces of tech in our lives: Smart Phone - A smart phone is a pretty desirable piece of virtual real estate.It has our GPS location, identity and contains a lot of info about our every day
    lives.
