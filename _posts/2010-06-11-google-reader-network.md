I recently removed a couple of aggregated tech news sources from my Google Reader. There are a few sources that I think are going beyond what I find valuable in my tech business world.
I am relying on my Google Network of friends to refer common stories from major tech news sources to me. I often found we were reading and sharing the same stuff.
I cleaned up some of these common sources and I'm looking to find more RSS subscriptions that come straight from the source. Such as corporate, startup blogs, and University programs.
So far I'm pretty hungry. Cleaning out my feeds as they come in every 30 minutes. First time in a while I'm left wanting more.
I'm relying on my Google Reader Network, and suggestions from colleagues. Let me know if you have any sources you recommend.
