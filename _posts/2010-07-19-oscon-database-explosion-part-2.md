<img class="alignnone c1" title="Schooner Information Technology" src="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/img/logos/schooner-logo.png" alt="" width="153" height="29" align="right" />After spending some time last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming [OSCON - Open Source Convention][1] I noticed a pattern:

**There is an explosion in database innovation right now** I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. I neglected a very notable database platform appliance company:

**[Schooner Information Technology**][2] They provide turnkey MySQL, NoSQL, and memcached appliances to work with data intensive web and social applications. I'm reviewing their two products now:

  * [MySQL Appliance][3]
  * [Memcached/NoSQL Appliance][4]
Looks like they have the solution for anyone looking to deploy MySQL or NoSQL key-value stores in their data center. I could see this being used internally or offered up as a cloud database service.
