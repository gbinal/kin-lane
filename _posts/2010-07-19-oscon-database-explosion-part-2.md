     <li>
          <a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/mysql_appliance" target="_blank">MySQL Appliance</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/memcached_nosql_cache_appliance" target="_blank">Memcached/NoSQL Appliance</a>
     </li>
</ul>

     Looks like they have the solution for anyone looking to deploy MySQL or NoSQL key-value stores in their data center. I could see this being used internally or offered up as a cloud database service.
