After spending some time last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming OSCON - Open Source Convention I noticed a pattern:
There is an explosion in database innovation right now
I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. I neglected a very notable database platform appliance company:
Schooner Information Technology
They provide turnkey MySQL, NoSQL, and memcached appliances to work with data intensive web and social applications. I'm reviewing their two products now:

	MySQL Appliance
	Memcached/NoSQL Appliance

Looks like they have the solution for anyone looking to deploy MySQL or NoSQL key-value stores in their data center. I could see this being used internally or offered up as a cloud database service.
