[TelasticStack allows you to offer your own brand of cloud servers][1]:

  * Turnkey Cloud Platform
  * Deployment Within Days
  * No UpFron Investment
  * Scalable Cloud Server
  * Modern Virtualization Back-End
  * Full Managed Operations
They say they have cloud hosting solutions for:
  * Existing hosting providers
  * Cloud Startups
  * Private Clouds
Seems like a viable business model in the cloud computing game. With everyone jumping on the "cloud" bandwagon a private label solution seems like a perfect option.
