You can now start your own cloud computing provider. <a href="http://www.elasticstack.com/" target="_blank">TelasticStack allows you to offer your own brand of cloud servers</a>:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Turnkey Cloud Platform
     </li>
     <li>Deployment Within Days
     </li>
     <li>No UpFron Investment
     </li>
     <li>Scalable Cloud Server
     </li>
     <li>Modern Virtualization Back-End
     </li>
     <li>Full Managed Operations
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     They say they have cloud hosting solutions for:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Existing hosting providers
     </li>
     <li>Cloud Startups
     </li>
     <li>Private Clouds
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Seems like a viable business model in the cloud computing game. With everyone jumping on the "cloud" bandwagon a private label solution seems like a perfect option.
