    Tags help give me a visual summary of a lot of my work.I deal with a lot of content and it is hard to see the high level view.Tag clouds give us a great perspective of everything from our Blogs
    to Google Reader and beyond.I dont make enough time to tag all my blog postings.Most of my blog entries are purely shooting from the hip as I have the thought.
