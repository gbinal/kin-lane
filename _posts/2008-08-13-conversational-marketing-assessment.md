    As part of every social media marketing strategy that we build we conduct a conversational marketing assessment that evaluates the target arena we are considering entering as part of the social
    media marketing campaign.<br />
    <br />
    We are noticing that pretty much every one of our clients has a very fragmented presence on the Internet and in the social media space.<br />
    <br />
    This is not their fault it is the nature of technology and the Internet moving forward as a company grasps their goals in this space. Having a web site has become the norm, however what do you do
    with Facebook, Youtube, blogs, and other areas.<br />
    <br />
    We are seeing that providing a conversational marketing assessment along with some sort of ecosystem visual showing where they exist is an excellent place to start.
