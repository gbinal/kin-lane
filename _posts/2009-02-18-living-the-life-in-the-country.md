    I have moved out to the woods to live for a while. After living last summer in Bend, OR I have decided to live a little more remote. I spent a lot of last summer out wining and dining clients,
    partying and just generally enjoying the Bend scene. This summer I am going to try a different approach. I am working on finding a work / life balance that works for me. Finding time to work hard
    on some projects while exploring the outdoors as well. So far I am loving my new place and some of the people I have met. The weather is still cold....some snow...but overall it is a great start.
    More to come...
