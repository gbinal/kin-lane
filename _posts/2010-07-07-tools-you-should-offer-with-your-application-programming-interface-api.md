    I am spending some time putting together some recommendations for a vendor on their API.They are a payment gateway, that offers something no other payment gateway offers.I really feel they could
    rock the market if they were better known.The problem is that they dont have a product manager and their Application Programming Interface (API) isnt presented well.In fact it isnt presented at
    all.
