    To achieve the perfect platform for how I operate and think I dont think one company can deliver by themselves.To create the perfect suite or set of tools that I need to operate on a daily basis
    I need different applications that interact and operate on a common standard and interface.I need to be able to try different perspectives and approaches.If an application doesnt work for me I
    need to be able to say NO!This doesnt work dammit, and show me others like it so I can try more.
