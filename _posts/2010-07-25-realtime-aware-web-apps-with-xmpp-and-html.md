<img class="alignnone c1" title="HTML 5" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/html5.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />I am spending time each week learning something new about HTML5 and brainstorming ways it can be applied in my every day business world.

Here are two areas I am researching:

  * Using [HTML 5 Web SQL Database][1] and [HTML5 Web Storage][2] to make web applications run more efficiently by running them locally.
  * Using [HTML 5 Web Sockets][3] and [HTML 5 Server-Sent Events][4] to allow my web applications to be real-time and aware as Internet is available.
I also just finished reading [How to Create an XMPP-Driven Application in JavaScript][5]. Using H[TML 5 Web Sockets][6] you can interface with any [XMPP][7] server and create a full-duplex communications channel within the web browser.

With all these improvements to HTML, HTML 5 seems like a logical choice for web and mobile application development.

**Update:** Also found this [web socket extension for Apache Web Server][8].
