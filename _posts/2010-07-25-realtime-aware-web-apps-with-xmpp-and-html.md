    I am spending time each week learning something new about HTML5 and brainstorming ways it can be applied in my every day business world.Here are two areas I am researching: Using HTML 5 Web SQL
    Database and HTML5 Web Storage to make web applications run more efficiently by running them locally.Using HTML 5 Web Sockets and HTML 5 Server-Sent Events to allow my web applications to be
    real-time and aware as Internet is available.I also just finished reading How to Create an XMPP-Driven Application in JavaScript.Using HTML 5 Web Sockets you can interface with any XMPP server
    and create a full-duplex communications channel within the web browser.
