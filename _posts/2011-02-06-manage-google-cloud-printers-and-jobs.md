{% include JB/setup %}<p>After you add a Google Cloud Printer you will need to manage the printers you have registered with the Google Cloud Print (GCP) registry.You can manage your your Google Cloud Printer(s) at:

	http://www.google.com/cloudprint/

It gives you My Printer and Shared Printer access where you can delete printers and see the status of each printer.This wont matter too much when you are just addding your own printers, but as you start to add random printers from work, other offices, hotels, conference centers and other public places it will become more critical.</p>
