    A project Im moving off the back-burner and into the public domain is a project I called Tech Blogger Analysis.My GF is Audrey Watters @ ReadWriteWeb, so I get exposed to an authors daily
    perspective in the tech blogging world.I started harvesting all the RSS feeds from ReadWriteWeb, Techcrunch, OReilly, Mashable, VentureBeat, and GigaOm.Upon harvest I would organize the post and
    curate author details, tags, etc.I had a whole bunch of scripts Id run to clean up, organize and centralize meta data.
