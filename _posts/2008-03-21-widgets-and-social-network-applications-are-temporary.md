{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just driving home tonight and thinking about all the widgets and OpenSocial applications I have been developing lately.Starting thinking about the limited distribution OpenSocial Applications and the wide distribution of widgets.I was playing with a real sweet Flash Distribution that was driven from XML.I was thinking about the different ways I could distribute it on web sites and social networks.Of course I think about how to make some use it and adopt it.</p>
