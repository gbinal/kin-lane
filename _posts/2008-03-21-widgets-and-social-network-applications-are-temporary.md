I was just driving home tonight and thinking about all the widgets and OpenSocial applications I have been developing lately.Starting thinking about the limited distribution OpenSocial Applications and the wide distribution of widgets.I was playing with a real sweet Flash Distribution that was driven from XML.  I was thinking about the different ways I could distribute it on web sites and social networks.Of course I think about how to make some use it and adopt it. Then I thought, is it really necessary to have some continue using an application? Can they just add it, get some value, and send back?If 100 people use and adopt it or 10,000 use it and lose it...what is more valuable.Just curious.
