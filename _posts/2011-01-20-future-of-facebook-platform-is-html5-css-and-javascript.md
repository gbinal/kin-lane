{% include JB/setup %}Facebook is jumping on the HTML5 bandwagon and supporting it within their developers community.
They are counting on HTML5 helping developers operate across web, desktop and mobile devices. They are proposing that all you would need to build Facebook apps is HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
They are holding a Tech Talk on this subject on Wednesday, January 26 at 7PM.
Spearkers will include:


	Laurent Desegur (Zynga) - Zynga recently launched their mobile version of Mafia Wars built fully with HTML and JavaScript. Laurent will talk about the successes as well as some challenges, mostly regarding variations between browsers, native shims, and performance.
	Charles Jolley (SproutCore) - SproutCore is an HTML5 app framework for building responsive, desktop-caliber apps in any modern Web browser. Charles will give an overview of how to use SproutCore in your own applications to take advantage of the latest Web technologies.
	Cory Ondrejka (Facebook) - Cory will speak about a project that exercises browsers under game-like conditions to measure how many sprites can move around on the screen at once. The server collects the performance data and spits it back in several forms.
