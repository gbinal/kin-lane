    I was talking with a Mimeo colleague today about a couple of cloud printing integrations.One of the integrations would potentially allow other commercial printers to augment their own services
    with Mimeo print products.We started talking about different ways that existing print shops could add capabilities like poster printing, without investing in the infrastructure to print and ship
    posters.Even beyond existing print shops, entrepreneurs with print business ideas can prototype, test, and even launch new print businesses without investing in the infrastructure.This is the
    promise of cloud printing.
