    I have seen a lot of discussion about the use of multiple social networks and how difficult it is to maintain your profile across these networks.I dont want a different profile at each of these
    networks.I want my one profile and these networks to come to me.I dont want to have go through a lengthy sign up process.I want to be instantly evaluated upon arrival and either let in.
