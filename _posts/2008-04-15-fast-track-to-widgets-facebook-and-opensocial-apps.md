    I have been deploying large amounts of widgets, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a> applications to various social
    networks and platforms lately.<br />
    <br />
    Even though I am a programmer I have been able to do much of my heavy lifting using tools that are already available to me without any programming at all.<br />
    <br />
    I use a combination of <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://www.ning.com">Ning</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and other social media content platforms. I
    then syndicate using their native tools and build widgets using <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com">Widgetbox</a>. Once I have my widgets deployed on Widgetbox I can then easily deploy to <a href=
    "http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.%20bebo.com">Bebo</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">IGoogle</a>, <a href=
    "http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> and any other platform that embraces OpenSocial.<br />
    <br />
    I am putting together a series of slides based upon this process for others to use. Look for another post regarding this process.
