I have been deploying large amounts of widgets, [Facebook][1] and [OpenSocial][2] applications to various social networks and platforms lately.

Even though I am a programmer I have been able to do much of my heavy lifting using tools that are already available to me without any programming at all.

I use a combination of [Youtube][3], [Ning][4], [Flickr][5] and other social media content platforms. I then syndicate using their native tools and build widgets using [Widgetbox][6]. Once I have my widgets deployed on Widgetbox I can then easily deploy to [Facebook][1], [Bebo][7], [MySpace][8], [IGoogle][9], [Orkut][10] and any other platform that embraces OpenSocial.

I am putting together a series of slides based upon this process for others to use. Look for another post regarding this process.
