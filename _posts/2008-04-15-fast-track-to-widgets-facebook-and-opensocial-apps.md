{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been deploying large amounts of widgets, Facebook and OpenSocial applications to various social networks and platforms lately.Even though I am a programmer I have been able to do much of my heavy lifting using tools that are already available to me without any programming at all.I use a combination of Youtube, Ning, Flickr and other social media content platforms.  I then syndicate using their native tools and build widgets using Widgetbox.  Once I have my widgets deployed on Widgetbox I can then easily deploy to Facebook, Bebo, MySpace, IGoogle, Orkut and any other platform that embraces OpenSocial.I am putting together a series of slides based upon this process for others to use.  Look for another post regarding this process.</p>
