    I have been deploying large amounts of widgets, Facebook and OpenSocial applications to various social networks and platforms lately.Even though I am a programmer I have been able to do much of
    my heavy lifting using tools that are already available to me without any programming at all.I use a combination of Youtube, Ning, Flickr and other social media content platforms.I then syndicate
    using their native tools and build widgets using Widgetbox.Once I have my widgets deployed on Widgetbox I can then easily deploy to Facebook, Bebo, MySpace, IGoogle, Orkut and any other platform
    that embraces OpenSocial.
