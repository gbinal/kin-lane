    I learned about TOR, a free software helps you defend against network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state
    security while reading the Rolling Stone Article about Jacob Appelbaum and his TOR evangelism.TOR is an interesting approach to privacy in this digital age for anyone looking for true
    anonymity.It was interesting to see even the military uses TOR.Now the Pentagon, has launched a new project with the opposite intent, designed to discover malicious behavior on Department of
    Defense networks.The project is called CINDER (Cyber INsiDER Threat).
