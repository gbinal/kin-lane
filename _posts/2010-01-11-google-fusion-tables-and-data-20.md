    I pulled this from the Google Research Blog.I was going to write my own, but they said it all.I just modified a little: Database systems are notorious for being hard to use.It is even more
    difficult to integrate data from multiple sources and collaborate on large data sets with people outside your organization.Without an easy way to offer all the collaborators access to the same
    server, data sets get copied, emailed and ftpd--resulting in multiple versions that get out of sync very quickly.
