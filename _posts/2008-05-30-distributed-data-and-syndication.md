{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am building out a pretty complex system that really seems like a lot of overhead to get some pretty basic systems up.It involves republishing small subsets of data to various data stores such as MySQL, Amazon S3, GData, or just XML.Then I syndicate web services / feeds in RSS, XML, JSON to those little data stores.I keep getting asked why dont you just allow one central data feed off main data store.From a security and load balancing standpoint the distributed piece just makes sense.</p>
