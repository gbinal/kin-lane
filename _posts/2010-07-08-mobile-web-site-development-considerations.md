<img class="alignnone c1" title="Mobile Browser" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile-site-development/mobile-browser.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I'm refining my strategy for best practices in designing mobile web sites. I just added a few RSS feeds from quality design firms, and added a Google Alert. I've put together a few things to consider when designing your web site for mobile browsers:

  * Keep it Simple
  * Use White Space
  * Make Wise Use of Images
  * Employ Mobile Specific Sub-Domains
  * Only Include High Value Content
  * Support Many Popular Screen Sizes
  * Rapid Change of Mobile Industry
  * Important Features / Essential
  * Know and Target Your market
Developing a web site or web application that runs well in mobile browsers doesn't have to be a huge undertaking, but you should put together a plan and consider these simple points. More to come as I keep blending together my [learning of HTML5][1] and [development of mobile websites][2].
