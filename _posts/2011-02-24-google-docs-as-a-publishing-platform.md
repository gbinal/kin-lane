Google Docs has always been a singular document editor for me. When you step back and look at it from 100K foot, you start to see a bigger picture.

I'm seeing the potential of Google Docs as a publishing platform. Google Docs can support publishing in three main areas:

**Document Management**

  * **Mobile** \- Hand held, cellular access to creating, editing, sharing and publishing documents.
    * **Smart Phone (Android, IPhone) -** Applications and code libraries for most smart phone platforms.
    * **Tablets (IPad) -** Applications and code libraries for tablet platforms.
  * **Connectors** \- Other companies provide Google Doc connectors for desktop and mobile platforms.
    * **Memeo** \- Brings Google Docs files to your Desktop, iPad
