    As Im spending a lot of time with Google Docs lately, Im getting to see it in a different perspective.Google Docs has always been a singular document editor for me.When you step back and look at
    it from 100K foot, you start to see a bigger picture.Im seeing the potential of Google Docs as a publishing platform.Google Docs can support publishing in three main areas: Document Management
    Mobile - Hand held, cellular access to creating, editing, sharing and publishing documents.
