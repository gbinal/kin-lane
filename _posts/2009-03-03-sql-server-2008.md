    We are using SQL Server 2008 as our primary database currently.We do a lot of replication and other SQL server advanced features.At first the management studio really frustrated me, its clunky
    and pop ups and warns you about everything.The more I use it, the more I get it though.I need to replicate sets of stored procedure and make a few changes and re-run to create a new set.
