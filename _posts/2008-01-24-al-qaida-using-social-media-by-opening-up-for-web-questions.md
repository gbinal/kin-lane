    I was just listening to an <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18337970">NPR story about how senior Al-Qaida</a> press department has asked supporters to submit
    questions on a message boards.<br />
    <br />
    Supposively they are to be answered by Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.<br />
    <br />
    Many jihadist and terrorists posted questions about he organization and what they should do?<br />
    <br />
    Seems everyone is seeing value in social media.
