Was just watching and enjoying a show of [Charlie Rose][1] that had [Chris Anderson of Wired][2] and Michael Arrington of [TechCrunch][3].

[Chris][2] was very informative and I'll have to watch again.

Michael Arrington was impressive. He covered tech as social issues in a way that kept me listening.

Will write more about. Good show guys.
