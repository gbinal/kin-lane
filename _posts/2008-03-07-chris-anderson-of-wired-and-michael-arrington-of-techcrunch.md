    Was just watching and enjoying a show of <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/home">Charlie Rose</a> that had <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html">Chris Anderson of Wired</a> and
    Michael Arrington of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>.<br />
    <br />
    <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html">Chris</a> was very informative and I'll have to watch again.<br />
    <br />
    Michael Arrington was impressive. He covered tech as social issues in a way that kept me listening.<br />
    <br />
    Will write more about. Good show guys.
