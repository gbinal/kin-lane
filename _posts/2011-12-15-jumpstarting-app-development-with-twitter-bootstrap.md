    Like many other engineers Ive worked with, Twitter engineers will use any set of tools they are familiar with to deliver the front-end of their applications.Many of us app developers arent UI
    experts, and many of the projects we build dont have requirements for a high quality UI, so we just slap together whatever we can.Which often looks like shit.Twitter has spearheaded an open
    source UI toolkit, meant to kickstart the development of web apps and sites, called Bootstrap.Twitter Bootstrap provides CSS and HTML for several key areas of UI development: Grids Layouts
    Typography Media Tables Forms Navigation Alerts Popovers Bootstraps also comes with custom plugins that work with jQuery and Ender, to make sure your UI is interactive and sexy.
