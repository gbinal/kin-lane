    I see a lot of speculation and talk about Googles social efforts compared to Facebook.Facebook is definitely a dominant player in this game, and everyone keeps waiting for a clear social move
    from Google.The defining characteristic between these two players is Facebook is building a social network within a walled garden.Facebook launches features and tools for bringing sites, content
    and users into this walled garden.Google operates on the open Internet.
