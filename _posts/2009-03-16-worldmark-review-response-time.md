    Just thought I'd post that I can another "please continue holding" response from Worldmark. I sent my original email on 03/04/2009...got an intial ticket response immdiately saying someone would
    response. I got another reponses saying they will respond: Please include the following line in all replies. Tracking number: UT20090316_0000000911 Thank you for taking the time to contact
    WorldMark. Due to extraordinarily high volumes, please allow up to 10 business days for a response. We value your questions and comments and are are diligently working to respond to your message.
    We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and sincerely appreciate your patience during this period. Best Regards, Wyndham Vacation Ownership I am asking them questions regarding how I
    can possibly exit my relationship with them. I am also asking them about the condos that I supposively own a piece of are available on Travelocity at the same time when I cannot book a room
    myself through the online or phone service. The saga continues...
