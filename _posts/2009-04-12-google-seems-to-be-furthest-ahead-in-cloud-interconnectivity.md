{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have come across several articles on Google's new Secure Data Connector. Definitely a huge step in legitimizing the usage of Google Docs within a corporate environment.
With the Google Secure Data connector you can access data within Google Gadgets, Google App Engine and Google Spreadsheets.
It gives you user access control to applications.
I was working on an overview of the opportunities Google provides for cloud computing interconnectivity as well (coming in next post). this Secure Data Connector really opens up the Google Cloud to operate with your internal business and enterprise systems.
I haven't plaid around much with it yet, bu tlooking forward to it.
