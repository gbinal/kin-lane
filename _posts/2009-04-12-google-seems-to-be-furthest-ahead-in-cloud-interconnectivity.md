    I have come across several articles on Googles new Secure Data Connector.Definitely a huge step in legitimizing the usage of Google Docs within a corporate environment.With the Google Secure Data
    connector you can access data within Google Gadgets, Google App Engine and Google Spreadsheets.It gives you user access control to applications.I was working on an overview of the opportunities
    Google provides for cloud computing interconnectivity as well (coming in next post).
