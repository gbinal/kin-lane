    I made some more changes to my network over the holidays.Im working to better tie together my blog(s) and my social network profiles using the rel= property.The process is a three part process,
    meant to link the various places I write with my author brand, that is represented in my social network profiles, most importantly Google +.I write on several blogs and I want the authorship of
    my work to be linked back to my Google + profile.Im very Google centric, so in my network this is the most important profile in my network.
