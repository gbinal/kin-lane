    This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist.API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career.While over the last two years
    I’ve worked for clients like Mimeo and CityGrid, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are
    transforming industries.This month, I’m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API
    ecosystems.
