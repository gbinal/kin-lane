{% include JB/setup %}<p>This summer its been 2 years since I started API Evangelist.API Evangelist started as my research project into the Business of APIs, and became a full time career.While over the last two years I&rsquo;ve worked for clients like Mimeo and CityGrid, my ultimate goal is to focus on studying the Business of APIs.So whenever I get the time, I study how popular APIs operate, and how they are transforming industries.This month, I&rsquo;m getting the opportunity to dive deeper into my research around different API business models, with the chance to look at the politics within specific API ecosystems.</p>
