{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the platforms I depend upon for my memory was hacked today.This afternoon, Evernote let everyone know that the platform was compromised and forced a reset of all passwords.While I&rsquo;d prefer all platforms I depend on could thwart any hacks, it seems like security breaches are becoming par for the course.I appreciate that Evernote immediately forced a password reset and because I use the desktop app, I immediately was prompted to update my password.&nbsp;
I also enjoy seeing the OAuth flow in action, where reciprocity providers like Zapier immediately take action.</p>
