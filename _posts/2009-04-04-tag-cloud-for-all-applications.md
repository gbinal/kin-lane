    Another thing to add to my wish list. It would be nice to have a keyword tag cloud for all my Google applications. The one provided for trends in Google is nice. I would like to see a trends
    section in Google Docs, Gmail, Calendar and any other Google Application. I think tag cloud and other similiar analytics and trends are helpful in stearing my work.
