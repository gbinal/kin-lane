    OExchange is an open protocol for sharing any URL with any service on the web.The Problem Lots of services accept URL-based content � social networks, news and bookmarking sites, communication
    tools, long-tail forums, translation and printing utilities � and more appear every day.Why do blogs still show chiclets for only the top few social networks?Why cant users engage with more
    personal, relevant, dynamically-discovered options?Why are sharing tools still integrating with services individually?
