    <a class="zem_slink" title="The Thinker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker">Rodin's Thinker</a> was stolen from the Singer Laren museum and damaged while the thieves
    were trying to destroy and sell it for scrap metal. At the request of the museum, a team of <a href="http://i.materialise.com/blog/entry/3d-printing-rodins-thinker" target="_blank">3D printers at
    Materialise, took 3D scans of the damaged statue</a> to assist in repairs. Using of of their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/imaterialise#p/u/3/ygHVVKkJWlI" target="_blank">Materialize 3D
    printing machines</a>, the largest 3D printer in the world, they created a mold that was used to restore the statue. An interesting example of how 3D printing is not just for creating new works,
    it can repair historic artifacts as well.
