At the request of the museum, a team of <a href="http://i.materialise.com/blog/entry/3d-printing-rodins-thinker" target="_blank">3D printers at Materialise, took 3D scans of the damaged statue</a> to assist in repairs.<p></p>
Using of of their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/imaterialise#p/u/3/ygHVVKkJWlI" target="_blank">Materialize 3D printing machines</a>, the largest 3D printer in the world, they created a mold that was used to restore the statue.<p></p>
An interesting example of how 3D printing is not just for creating new works, it can repair historic artifacts as well.
