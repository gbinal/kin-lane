At the request of the museum, a team of [3D printers at Materialise, took 3D scans of the damaged statue][1] to assist in repairs.

Using of of their [Materialize 3D printing machines][3], the largest 3D printer in the world, they created a mold that was used to restore the statue.

An interesting example of how 3D printing is not just for creating new works, it can repair historic artifacts as well.
