{% include JB/setup %}<p>A couple of weeks ago I was writing about tools you should offer with your Application Programming Interface (API).I was putting together some thoughts on ways a vendor could improve their API developer experience.I have several deployments with their API under my belt and felt I had some advice to offer.We have had a few major problems with outages and errors with the vendors API.Howver most of our problems as an API consumner has been around:

	Lack of community
	Lack of documentation or quality documentation
	No example code, snippets, or SDK
	Poor support via email, forums

I felt like we were operating in a vaccuum.</p>
