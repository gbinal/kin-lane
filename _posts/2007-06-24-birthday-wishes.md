    I got 3 birthday wishes today from sites that I have signed up for. Birthdays do not mean much to me, I really do not hold it against anyone for forgetting my Birthday.<br />
    <br />
    I really do not look to celebrate my Birthday. However it does stick in my mind when someone wishes me a Happy Birthday. It is just one of those subtle little items that I remember.<br />
    <br />
    3 different software services I have signed up for using the data I signed up with sent out a Happy Birthday to me.<br />
    <br />
    What a great way to reach a users heart and develop a loyal relationship.
