    I got 3 birthday wishes today from sites that I have signed up for.Birthdays do not mean much to me, I really do not hold it against anyone for forgetting my Birthday.I really do not look to
    celebrate my Birthday.However it does stick in my mind when someone wishes me a Happy Birthday.It is just one of those subtle little items that I remember.
