    There are so many opportunities on the Internet for marketing your business using social media, it is easy to get distracted and dilute your efforts.Having a strategy before you embark on social
    media marketing is extremely important, and revisiting this strategy regularly is critical to evolving and changing your approach so that you find success.Focusing your campaign in one specific
    conversation or topic is critical to keeping your approach and target audience small enough so that you can find success and interact with them in a valuable way.Of course you can scale and grow
    into larger or more conversations as your resources and approach grow.While monitoring and participating in a specific conversation it is very important to continually extract smaller topics that
    are dictated by the public at large that are involved in social media.
