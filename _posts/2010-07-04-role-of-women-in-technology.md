    As a big dumb white guy, I often fall into the common trap that is set in our society.The trap that white men rule.I get to play dumb to the fact that there is injustice in the world.Ive worked
    with clients where everything is perfect as long as Im managing the project.As soon as I bring in my right hand (a woman), or my development support, things can go wrong.
