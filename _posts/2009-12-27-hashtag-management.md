    Just doing some reading and organizing thoughts on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> Hash Tags. Seems like hash tag management is becoming a regular occurrence in every day business.
    Companies should be establishing, disseminating, and evaluating hash tags for their company. Seems like at a basic level a company should establish and regularly use # hash tags for their
    company. <a href="http://twitter.com/kinlane">#KinLane</a> Then they should then establish # hash tags for prominent areas of their companies like brands, products and services. #KinLaneCloud
    #KinLaneEvent A company should create and maintain a master list of official # hash tags that can be used internally and officially recognized for public use as well. Regular evaluation of # hash
    tags at Twitter, Facebook and other top social sites and event the web and blogosphere at large.
