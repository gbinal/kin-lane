    Just doing some reading and organizing thoughts on Twitter Hash Tags.Seems like hash tag management is becoming a regular occurrence in every day business.Companies should be establishing,
    disseminating, and evaluating hash tags for their company.Seems like at a basic level a company should establish and regularly use # hash tags for their company.#KinLane Then they should then
    establish # hash tags for prominent areas of their companies like brands, products and services.
