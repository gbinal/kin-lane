Just doing some reading and organizing thoughts on [Twitter][1] Hash Tags. Seems like hash tag management is becoming a regular occurrence in every day business.

Companies should be establishing, disseminating, and evaluating hash tags for their company. Seems like at a basic level a company should establish and regularly use # hash tags for their company. [#KinLane][2]

Then they should then establish # hash tags for prominent areas of their companies like brands, products and services. #KinLaneCloud #KinLaneEvent

A company should create and maintain a master list of official # hash tags that can be used internally and officially recognized for public use as well.

Regular evaluation of # hash tags at Twitter, Facebook and other top social sites and event the web and blogosphere at large.
