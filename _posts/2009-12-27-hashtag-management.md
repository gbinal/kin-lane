{% include JB/setup %}Just doing some reading and organizing thoughts on Twitter Hash Tags. Seems like hash tag management is becoming a regular occurrence in every day business.
Companies should be establishing, disseminating, and evaluating hash tags for their company. Seems like at a basic level a company should establish and regularly use # hash tags for their company. #KinLane
Then they should then establish # hash tags for prominent areas of their companies like brands, products and services. #KinLaneCloud #KinLaneEvent
A company should create and maintain a master list of official # hash tags that can be used internally and officially recognized for public use as well.
Regular evaluation of # hash tags at Twitter, Facebook and other top social sites and event the web and blogosphere at large.
