    I was reading a great post in Gigaom about community broadband.In short, this company called netBlazr wants to create a community supported broadband network using a commercially available and
    industry-tested radio access and networking equipment.They are doing this in Boston, but could be implemented anywhere.netBlazr wants to enlist individuals and business toparticipateby purchasing
    $300 worth of equipment, deploying, and connecting to the network, then share the Internet with others around you.This approach could work well for delivering neighborhood and metropolitan area
    networks, but would still need backbone connections to be part of the world wide web.
