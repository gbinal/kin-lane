{% include JB/setup %}<p>I see many companies and clients jumping on the developing an IPhone Application bandwagon.Its definitely a hot medium for delivering your web application, content, products and services to.One big disconnect I see is that many companies dont even have a mobile friendly version of their web site or application yet.Enabling your customers and users to be able to get at your companies information, products, services and other important offerings through the standard mobile browsers and screen resolutions seems like a great start.IPhone Applications average about 15-35K in my experience.</p>
