{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading a great post on Oreilly Radar called The Future of Our Cities: Open, Crowdsourced, and Participatory, and it got my brain flowing in a direction I have already been thinking about.I am really obsessed with Cloud Computing right now and the power it puts in my hand as the VP of Technology @ WebEvents Global.I am able to scale and grow our infrastructure as needed, and in the event industry this is very important.We used to either over-allocate or under-allocate server, bandwidth and storage needs because it is very hard to justify the budget to buy the amount of servers needed to support our peak points.Cloud Computing has revolutionized my approach to meeting the needs of our customers.</p>
