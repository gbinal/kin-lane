    I was sitting in on a session at the OReilly Velocity Conference today, by Chris Blizzard of the Mozilla Foundation.Chris talked covered a wide range of topics in his 20 minutes, but one project
    really caught my attention.It is aPDF Reader in JavaScript.The PDF reader(aka pdf.js), is a technology prototype to explore whether the HTML5 platform is complete enough to faithfully and
    efficiently render the ISO implementation of the Portable Document Format (PDF).
