{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have talked a little about how I organize my information using the Google Platform.I use Google Reader and Google Notebook to do all my research and thought gathering.I then use Google Docs to group and further refine my thoughts.I am working more with using the collaboration features to work with others to refine these thoughts in Google Docs as well.I have a constant problem with information and topics I would like to keep relevant getting buried and forgot about, and unless I search for them I dont remember.</p>
