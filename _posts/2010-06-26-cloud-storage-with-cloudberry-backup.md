    <img class="alignnone" style="padding: 10px;" title="Cloudberry Backup" src="http://images.cloudberrylab.com/products/backup_box.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="170" align="right" />I am always
    trying to keep an eye on various <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/06/data-storage-in-the-clouds/">cloud storage solutions</a>. A company called <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com" target=
    "_blank">Cloudberry</a> has been offering an <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a> storage client called <a href=
    "http://www.kinlane.com/2009/04/amazon-s3-client-tool/">CloudBerry Explorer</a> for a while. Now they are targeting the data backup and restore marketing with their <a href=
    "http://cloudberrylab.com/default.aspx?page=cloudberry-backup">CloudBerry Backup</a>. Current features include:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Maintain the same data structure on AmazonS3 as you have on your local computer
      </li>
      <li>Support for Amazon Reduced Redundancy Storage
      </li>
      <li>Asia Pacific Region support
      </li>
      <li>Secure Storage
      </li>
      <li>Data Versioning
      </li>
    </ul>Features coming soon are:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Expose Amazon S3 storage as a local disk on your computer
      </li>
      <li>Storage costs estimates
      </li>
      <li>Web interface
      </li>
      <li>FTP support
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.nirvanix.com/products-services/storage-delivery-network/index.aspx" target="_blank">Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network</a> support
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/windowsazure/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Blob Storage</a> support
      </li>
    </ul>Interesting to see another player in the cloud backup game. <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com" target="_blank">CloudBerry</a> seem to be going down similar road as Jungle Disk with their
    support of alternate cloud storage providers Nirvanix, and Microsoft Azure Blog Storage. I would still like to see one provider offer a standard cloud storage client for <span style=
    "text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> cloud storage providers.
