<img class="alignnone c1" title="Cloudberry Backup" src="http://images.cloudberrylab.com/products/backup_box.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="170" align="right" />I am always trying to keep an eye on various [cloud storage solutions][1]. A company called [Cloudberry][2] has been offering an [Amazon S3][3] storage client called [CloudBerry Explorer][4] for a while.

Now they are targeting the data backup and restore marketing with their [CloudBerry Backup][5]. Current features include:

  * Maintain the same data structure on AmazonS3 as you have on your local computer
  * Support for Amazon Reduced Redundancy Storage
  * Asia Pacific Region support
  * Secure Storage
  * Data Versioning
Features coming soon are:
  * Expose Amazon S3 storage as a local disk on your computer
  * Storage costs estimates
  * Web interface
  * FTP support
  * [Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network][6] support
  * [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage][7] support
Interesting to see another player in the cloud backup game. [CloudBerry][2] seem to be going down similar road as Jungle Disk with their support of alternate cloud storage providers Nirvanix, and Microsoft Azure Blog Storage. I would still like to see one provider offer a standard cloud storage client for ALL cloud storage providers.
