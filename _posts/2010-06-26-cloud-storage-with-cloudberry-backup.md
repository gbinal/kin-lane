    I am always trying to keep an eye on various cloud storage solutions.A company called Cloudberry has been offering an Amazon S3 storage client called CloudBerry Explorer for a while.Now they are
    targeting the data backup and restore marketing with their CloudBerry Backup.Current features include: Maintain the same data structure on AmazonS3 as you have on your local computer Support for
    Amazon Reduced Redundancy Storage Asia Pacific Region support Secure Storage Data Versioning Features coming soon are: Expose Amazon S3 storage as a local disk on your computer Storage costs
    estimates Web interface FTP support Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network support Microsoft Azure Blob Storage support Interesting to see another player in the cloud backup game.CloudBerry seem to be
    going down similar road as Jungle Disk with their support of alternate cloud storage providers Nirvanix, and Microsoft Azure Blog Storage.
