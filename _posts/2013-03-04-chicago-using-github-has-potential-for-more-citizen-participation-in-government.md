    Github is not just a site for managing code, for use by programmers.The platform can host code, data, markup, markdown and files like images, pdf, etc.Basically anything you can store in a file,
    and apply versioning to, you can put Github to work, helping you manage collaboration and the assets evolution.The City of Chicago just published five datasets including street locations,
    building footprints, bike routes, pedway routes and bike rack locations on Github--released under the MIT license, giving anyone the right to download, modify and reuse, even for commercial
    purposes.The move to Github goes beyond just making street locations, building footprints, bike routes, pedway routes and bike rack locations open for download and reuse.
