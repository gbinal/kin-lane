    Was just viewing my last blog post and noticed the Google Sidewiki that I had installed recently. I haven't given it much thought since I installed. Then it asked me to comment on one of my blog
    posts. It says: <strong>As the page owner, you can write a special entry that will remain the top entry for this page.</strong> What should I write? What is the best tone to take when comment on
    your blog or page?
