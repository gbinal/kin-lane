{% include JB/setup %}I am fascinated by APIs.  I got to listen to the engineer from Mashery talk about their API services the other day.  Ever since then I've been thinking a lot more about APIs.  I just reviewed 25 top APIs out there:

	Flickr API
	Evernote
	Twitter
	Delicious
	Youtube
	Facebook
	Ebay
	Last.fm
	Digg
	Box.net
	Bing
	Salesforce
	Google Earth API
	Skype
	LinkedIn API
	Yahoo Developer Network
	Zillow
	Vimeo
	37 Signals
	Tumblr
	GetGlue
	Amazon Web Services
	Eventful
	Twilio
	Shopping.com

I've been looking at each providers approach to delivering an API ecosystem.  Lots of different approaches and common building blocks.
Google wins for the most simplest approach to deploying APIs. Salesforce definitely is the leader in delivering a very robust and complete API ecosystem, its no wonder they are the leading Software as a Service (SaaS) provider.
