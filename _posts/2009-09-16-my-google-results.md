{% include JB/setup %}<p>I guess Facebook beating out my blog when searching for my name "Kin Lane" @ Google was a temporary thing . The results are fairly normal now.
I haven't reported what my top 10 are for a while. They tend to reflect the top social platforms out there.

	Kin Lane
	Flickr: kin.lane's Photostream
	Kin Lane - FriendFeed
	Kin Lane's Member Profile Page | Fast Company
	Kin Lane — Big Think
	Kin Lane (kinlane) on Twitter
	Kin Lane - LinkedIn
	Kin Lane - Eugene, OR | Facebook
	Uncategorized - Kin Lane
	Kin Lane's Public Profile

My blog is back on top. The top social networks are present. Big Think consistently is on top as well as Fast Company. Interesting.</p>
