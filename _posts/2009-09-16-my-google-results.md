I guess Facebook beating out my blog when searching for my name "Kin Lane" @ Google was a temporary thing . The results are fairly normal now.

I haven't reported what my top 10 are for a while. They tend to reflect the top social platforms out there.

  * [Kin Lane][1]
  * [Flickr: kin.lane's Photostream][2]
  * [Kin Lane - FriendFeed][3]
  * [Kin Lane's Member Profile Page | Fast Company][4]
  * [Kin Lane ï¿½ Big Think][5]
  * [Kin Lane (kinlane) on Twitter][6]
  * [Kin Lane - LinkedIn][7]
  * [Kin Lane - Eugene, OR | Facebook][8]
  * [Uncategorized - Kin Lane][9]
  * [Kin Lane's Public Profile][10]
My blog is back on top. The top social networks are present. Big Think consistently is on top as well as Fast Company. Interesting.
