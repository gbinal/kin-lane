     Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days: Firefox - 40.55% Chrome - 30.86% Safari - 11.90% Internet Explorer - 11.19% Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!
