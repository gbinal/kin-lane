    Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Firefox - 40.55%
      </li>
      <li>Chrome - 30.86%
      </li>
      <li>Safari - 11.90%
      </li>
      <li>Internet Explorer - 11.19%
      </li>
    </ul>Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!
