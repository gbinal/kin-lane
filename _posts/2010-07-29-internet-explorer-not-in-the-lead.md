     Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Firefox - 40.55%
     </li>

     <li>Chrome - 30.86%
     </li>

     <li>Safari - 11.90%
     </li>

     <li>Internet Explorer - 11.19%
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!
