{% include JB/setup %}Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days:

	Firefox - 40.55%
	Chrome - 30.86%
	Safari - 11.90%
	Internet Explorer - 11.19%

Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!
