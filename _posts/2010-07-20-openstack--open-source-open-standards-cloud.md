There has been a lot of discussion around the need for a [cloud storage API standard][3], and whether or not [Amazon should be the base for an cloud computing standard][4].

I think it is a very smart move for [Rackspace][1] to step up in this way. It will do a lot for the industry and cloud adoption, and put them ahead in the game. I see a couple of immediate benefits:

  * Availability of proven open source software to get compute or storage infrastructure up and running
  * Promote standard of operation between cloud service providers
  * Opportunities for city, state, and federal government to deploy cloud infrastructure
I like how they focused on the cloud computing essentials:
  * [Computing Power][5]
  * [Object Storage][6]
Check out this list of projects they are working on:
  * [OpenStack Compute (nova)][7]
  * [openstack-android][8]
  * [OpenStack Development Infrastructure][9]
  * [openstack-ipad][10]
  * [openstack-iphone][11]
  * [openstack-web-control-panel][12]
  * [OpenStack Object Storage (swift)][13]
Open Source cloud compute power and cloud object storage. Mobile platform support for IPad, IPhone, and Android. Management tools and development tools. Very nice.

And you can't have a much cooler launch partner than NASA.
