One search term I've seen come up in my Google Analytics frequestly is:

[Mimeo.com][1] vs. [Lulu.com][2] I wanted to help people understand the difference.

Lulu.com lets you make, self-publish, print and sell print-on-demand books, e-books, photo books and calendars.

[Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Platform][3] lets you build Lulu's.

This means you can build self-publishing web sites and applications that leverage the printing power of Mimeo.com
