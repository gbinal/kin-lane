    This post is more rant, and about me working through my thoughts on this subject, which is why its on kinlane.com and not apievangelist.com or apivoice.com.&nbsp;This post is an aggregation of
    ongoing thoughts Im having around my role in the API space, a diagram I drew the other day while enjoying an IPA, and inescapable thoughts fueled up by a post by&nbsp;Patrick Meir over at
    iRevolution, called Crisis Mapping, Neogeography and the Delusion of Democratization.
