    Not everyone knows you can about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">Amazon Web Services Platform</a> let alone that you can use it to create highly scalable
    applications for Facebook.<br />
    <br />
    Amazon Web Services is an ideal hosting environment for these applications. Developers can start small, test and prove out their ideas, and then rapidly add processing and storage resources as
    they develop an audience.<br />
    <br />
    Amazon is talking about building Facebook Applications on AWS and you can visit a new page on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=391557011">Building Facebook Applications on the
    Amazon Web Services Platform</a>, you can find step-by-step instructions for registration along with links to tutorials, and even a pre-built EC2 AMI.<br />
    <br />
    Nice to see them working to promote and educate people on how to use the AWS Platform to inexpensively build highly scalable Facebook applications.
