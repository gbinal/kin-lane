{% include JB/setup %}Google releasde Google Chrome 5.0.375.86 on Thursday which includes integrated flash player being enabled by default. Interesting positioning by Google in the Flash v HTML5 battle.
Google Chrome is a leader in embracing HTML5 standards in their browser.
Now they are also further embracing Flash by allowing default integration and updates within Chrome. I think this is a wise move to encourage widespread adoption of Google Chrome as default browser.
