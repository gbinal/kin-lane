<img class="alignnone c1" title="Google Chrome" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-chrome-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google releasde [Google Chrome 5.0.375.86][1] on Thursday which includes _**integrated flash player being enabled by default**_. Interesting positioning by Google in the Flash v HTML5 battle.

Google Chrome is a leader in embracing [HTML5 standards][2] in their browser.

Now they are also further embracing Flash by allowing default integration and updates within Chrome. I think this is a wise move to encourage widespread adoption of [Google Chrom][3]e as default browser.
