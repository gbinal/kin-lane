    Im reading all the posts, tweets and streams about Google losing the emails of a whole bunch of Gmail accounts.I see the the cloud computing naysayers stepping up with, SEE, dont get too
    dependent on the cloud!It reminds me of a company I worked at once, where after 48 hours of Microsoft Exchange server being down, IT held a meeting and said everyones email accounts were removed
    and there were no backups.Everyone gets to start fresh with their email account!The Gmail loss of emails reminds me.
