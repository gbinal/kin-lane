    Was reading a post on Programmable Web today about Sprint opening up a set of REST API to work with the Sprint mobile platform.Developers can now access location, simple presence, and send SMS
    messages to Sprint handsets without requiring any software installed to the device.This is an important business step for the major carrier.Application Program Interfaces or API is something all
    small to medium sized business should be considering.You have spent thousands of hours on your web application or web site that provides access to your tools, products or services to your
    customers.
