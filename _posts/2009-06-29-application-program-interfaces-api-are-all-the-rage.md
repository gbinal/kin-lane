    Was reading a post on Programmable Web today about <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/06/29/sprint-opens-api-gets-openly-restful/">Sprint opening up a set of REST API</a> to work with
    the Sprint mobile platform. Developers can now access location, simple presence, and send SMS messages to Sprint handsets without requiring any software installed to the device. This is an
    important business step for the major carrier. Application Program Interfaces or API is something all small to medium sized business should be considering. You have spent thousands of hours on
    your web application or web site that provides access to your tools, products or services to your customers. You should now extend a wholesale access to these tools, content, products or services
    to your partners and potential affiliates. Application Program Interfaces is one of the next major growth areas you will see for all businesses. Making your products and services available for
    consumption and delivery beyond your web site is key to your evolution.
