<img class="c1" title="Wordpress" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />I've set up quite a few [Wordpress][1] blogs in my day. I've spent hours and hours looking for a theme for various [Wordpress][2] installations.

In some recent searching I came across a new site of [FREE and Premium Wordpress Themes][3].

[WPExplorer][3] has the cleanest and most functional [Wordpress][4] themes I've seen.

They seem to be owned by or work with [Templatic][5].
