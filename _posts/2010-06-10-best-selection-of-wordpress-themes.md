    Ive set up quite a few Wordpress blogs in my day.Ive spent hours and hours looking for a theme for various Wordpress installations.In some recent searching I came across a new site of FREE and
    Premium Wordpress Themes.WPExplorer has the cleanest and most functional Wordpress themes Ive seen.They seem to be owned by or work with Templatic.
