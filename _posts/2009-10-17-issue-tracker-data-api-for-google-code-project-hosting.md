    I Was just reading on the Google Code blog that they just released a new issue tracker data API for projects that you host on Google Code.It is a public ticketing / bug tracking system for you to
    use.Makes sense.Wish I had more open source projects to work on so I could use Google Code and take advantage of the community at large to innovate.
