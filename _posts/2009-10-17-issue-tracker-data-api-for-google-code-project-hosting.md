    I Was just reading on the <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> blog that they just released a new <a href=
    "http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/10/issue-tracker-data-api-for-project.html">issue tracker data API for projects that you host on Google Code</a>.<img title=
    "Image representing Google Code as depicted in ..." src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/2872/12872v1-max-450x450.png" alt="" width="153" height="55" align="right" /> It is a
    public ticketing / bug tracking system for you to use. Makes sense. Wish I had more open source projects to work on so I could use <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> and take
    advantage of the community at large to innovate.
