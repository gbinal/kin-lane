I Was just reading on the [Google Code][1] blog that they just released a new [issue tracker data API for projects that you host on Google Code][2].<img title="Image representing Google Code as depicted in ..." src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/2872/12872v1-max-450x450.png" alt="" width="153" height="55" align="right" />

It is a public ticketing / bug tracking system for you to use.

Makes sense. Wish I had more open source projects to work on so I could use [Google Code][1] and take advantage of the community at large to innovate.
