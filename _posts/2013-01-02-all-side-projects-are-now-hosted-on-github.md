    I’m working through the 2012 year, trying to quantify what I did over the year.It’s not as easy as it sounds.One area I’m having trouble quantifying is how much programming I do.Programming is an
    essential variable in my happiness algorithm.If I’m not programming a certain amount each week on projects, I can get very grumpy.
