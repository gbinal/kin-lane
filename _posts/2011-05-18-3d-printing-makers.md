    "http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">creators</a> to develop 3D models of physical objects, it takes makers, who are people that actually bring these virtual representations
    into the world. <a title="3D Printers" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printers-printers/">3D printers</a> do most of the work, but it takes someone who knows the machine, materials and
    process to bring these 3D models to life. Many industries will adopt 3D printing, increasing the need for specialized talent understanding the needs of each sector, and how the printers, process
    and materials serve these sectors. Creators will understand objects in a virtual format, and makers will understand them in a physical form. 3D printing is still a relatively new technology and
    will require constant improving as it evolves, makers will feed this evolution, and provide the knowledge to move the industry forward. Makers are are another important human link in the evolving
