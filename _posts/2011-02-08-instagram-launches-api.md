<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/instagram.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I wrote about [Instagram doing one thing really well][1], and since then I have been getting a lot of searches for the key phrase: **_instagram api_** over the last couple months.

I was going to blog about it, but [Instragram][2] beat me to the punch and [launched an API][3]. You can now access your Instagram account through an API and integrate it with other applications.

I would like to see a photo book generated from [Instragram][4] photos. You could make some real cool artwork for the covers....and a layout that really compliments the Instagram photos.

With the Instragram API it would be easy to pull photos, merge them with a layout template and generate a PDF. You can then pass along with cover art to the Mimeo Cloud Print API for printing as a photobook.

Excited about the Instagram API and the potential for print.
