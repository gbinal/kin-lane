[Box.net][1] has [announced new integration][2] with the Google Docs Platform. Box.net users can now create, edit and collaborate using [Google Docs][3], while logged into their regular Box.net account.

This type of interoperability between cloud storage is very import to cloud adoption. I personally use both cloud storage environments, but for very different reasons.

I use Box.net for higher quality storage of business documents like my presentation materials, high resolution images, and other documents I'm likely to print. I can print [single sheet][4], [bound documents][5] or posters using my Box.net.

Since I do a lot of my document creation at Google Docs, and store my more completed materials on Box.net it is very helpful to have access between the two services.

I can create and collaboration on document creation on Google Docs, then migrate that over to Box.net for use in various demos, presentations, and talks. Then I can also generate print materials using the Box.net API and [Mimeo Connect][6].

This type of interoperability is a perfect opportunity to use different cloud storage environments based upon your companies usage, what vendors and clients use, or just purely because of your preference.

I will be printing from Google Docs using [Google Cloud Print][7], and Box.net just to keep fluent in how to print on demand from both Box.net and Google Apps.
