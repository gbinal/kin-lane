    Im learning more and more about distributed computing as Im playing with larger and larger volumes of data.I understand a lot of the concepts behind the popular distributed computing platform
    Hadoop, but have no actual experience deploying it.Im diving into all the building blocks of Hadoop one by one as I have time: Hadoop Common - The common utilities that support the other Hadoop
    subprojects.Chukwa -A data collection system for managing large distributed systems.HBase - A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.
