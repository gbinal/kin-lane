    Was readng a post on CopyBlogger about Catablogging.What is catablogging you ask?Do we really need new terminology for the way you blog?A catablog is basically a blog that is designed to mix
    content and commerce in a very deliberate fashion.Its looking to attract people who are interested in buying things, but who are also interested in immersing themselves in the lifestyle
    surrounding the products.
