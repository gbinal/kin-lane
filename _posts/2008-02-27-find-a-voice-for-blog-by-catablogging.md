{% include JB/setup %}<p>Was readng a post on CopyBlogger about Catablogging.   What is catablogging you ask?  Do we really need  new terminology for the way you blog?A catablog is basically a blog that is designed to mix content and commerce in a very deliberate fashion. It's looking to attract people who are interested in buying things, but who are also interested in immersing themselves in the lifestyle surrounding the products.I thought the blog post described an interesting way of quickly developing a voice for your blog.  I think that is a big problem for most bloggers to gain traction.  I know I have.Catablogging essentially allows you to piggyback on an existing brand or product line and evolve your voice around that.This isn't necessarily somethinI am interested in doing, but I could see the value in making money by doing this.  Really getting to know a product, line of products and the customer / fan base around that.</p>
