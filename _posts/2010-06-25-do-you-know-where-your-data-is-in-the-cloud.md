I was just reading about [CentriLogic's new cloud hosting services.][1] They store your data across data centers in [Rochester NY][2], [Buffalo NY][3], [Toronto ON][4], and [Mississauga, ON][5].

With [Amazon EC2][6] and [cloudfront distributions][7] you can deploy your data across United States, European, Hong Kong and Singapore, and Japan edge locations.

[Country-specific regulations governing privacy and data protection][8] vary greatly. [Here is a map that outlines the degree of legal strictness across a range of nations][8]:

**Most Restrictive**<img class="alignnone c1" title="Interactive Data Heap Map" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-computing/Interactive-Data-Heat-Map.PNG" alt="" width="400" align="right" /><img class="alignnone c1" title="Interactive Data Heap Map" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-computing/Interactive-Data-Heat-Map2.PNG" alt="" width="400" align="right" /><img class="alignnone c1" title="Interactive Data Heap Map" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/cloud-computing/Interactive-Data-Heat-Map3.PNG" alt="" width="400" align="right" />

Interested in how Data Protection Regulations affect IT operations, cloud computing and cloud storage you can read Forrester's research on the significance of data protection regulations in the cloud:
  * **[Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IaaS) Clouds Are Local And So Are Their Implications, Know Where Your Cloud Is Before Deploying**][9] by James Staten and Onica King
  * **[As IaaS Cloud Adoption Goes Global, Tech Vendors Must Address Local Concerns, Infrastructure-As-A-Service Clouds Are Local, And So Are Their Implications**][10] by Jennifer Belissent, Ph.D.
Seems like you could make a cloud storage provider that just catered to the regulatory needs of various companies and the types of content they need to store and industries they are part of.
