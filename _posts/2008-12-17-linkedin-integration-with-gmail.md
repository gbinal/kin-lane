{% include JB/setup %}<p>While building my network on LinkedIn and searching for friends of course I came across the screen offering to use my Gmail, AOl or other address book to find people to connect with.Of course I did this and started selecting the people that I wanted to send an invite too.Pretty soon I got tired of filtering the hundreds of people.and just hit send.Hoping some of the people would connect.</p>
