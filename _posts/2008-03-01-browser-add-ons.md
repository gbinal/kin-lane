I am pretty addicted to to Firefox Browser Add-Ons.  I have many of them to the point of add-on overload.I use them for adding items to my Google Notebook, Amazon S3, CoComment, and much more.I syndicate and share to many social networks, social bookmarking, and other sharing sites.I do all this through Firefox.  So recently I have been using Firefox for a primary business function which requires a cookie.  So I need to use Internet Explorer for my personal online view. I pay attention to my Google Information and other stuff.  All of a sudden I feel lost without my add-ons.  I try to right click to add things to my Google Notebook, I try to share.  NOTHING.So I go to search the Internet Explorer Add-Ons.  There really isn't much?  Whats the deal?Why is there such a movemtn behind firefox on this?  I couldn't live without my browser and add-ons?  Is this not ordinary?Internet Exlporer still has like 60+ % market share.  Why isn't there a browser add-on movement?I am working on the specs for a firefox add-on specification.   I worry that mainstream doesn't get it and will never adop browser toolbars and add-ons.Browser Tools have become more important to me than desktop tools.  The only desktop tools I stil use are Dreamweaver.    Everything else is in my browser.I know I am not the normal.  Is this weird.Just trying to understand why Internet Explorer with such huge market share does not have the add-on following?
