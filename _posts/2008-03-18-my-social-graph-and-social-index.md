    Graph Definition: Social Graph is the network of connections that exist through which people communicate and share information.Social Index Definition - Social Index is a measurement of the
    value, size and velocity of a social graph.I have tried several ways to track my social graph and social index, and recently there has been several tools released to assist.Such as Google Social
    Graph API, MyBlogLog, Plaxo, FriendFeed, and Disqus.
