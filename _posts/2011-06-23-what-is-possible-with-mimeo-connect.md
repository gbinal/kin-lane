I'm working on a series of presentations showing what is possible with the [Mimeo Connect Cloud Print Platform][1].

Sometimes its difficult to show people the 100K foot level of what you can do with the [print API][2].

This presentation is from a demo I did for some print industry executives, to wet their appetite for what is possible.

It covers:

  * What is Mimeo?
  * What is Mimeo Connect?
  * Documents That Do Not Change
  * Documents With Dynamic Content
  * Application Integration
  * Cloud Storage Integration
  * Cloud Printing Integration
  * Innovate and Print from Any Platform
I hope this helps show the infinite possiblities of what you can do with printing and publishing using the Mimeo Connect Platform.
