{% include JB/setup %}<p>I'm working on a series of presentations showing what is possible with the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print Platform.
Sometimes its difficult to show people the 100K foot level of what you can do with the print API.
This presentation is from a demo I did for some print industry executives, to wet their appetite for what is possible.
It covers:

	What is Mimeo?
	What is Mimeo Connect?
	Documents That Do Not Change
	Documents With Dynamic Content
	Application Integration
	Cloud Storage Integration
	Cloud Printing Integration
	Innovate and Print from Any Platform

I hope this helps show the infinite possiblities of what you can do with printing and publishing using the Mimeo Connect Platform.
