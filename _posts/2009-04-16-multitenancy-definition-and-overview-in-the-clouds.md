    So I was laying down by the river today in the sun and had a set of initial thoughts around defining and quantifying my tenancy within the cloud.I really want to see my presence more defined so I
    have a better understanding and control.Here are some initial thoughts.So my presence in the cloud usually is going to reside in a tenancy slot at on or more data centers, without getting too
    technical.Depending on the size and importance of my company or presence my tenancy will be of concern to several groups, and offer different perspectives: Client - This is my perspective or the
    client who is leasing this service.
