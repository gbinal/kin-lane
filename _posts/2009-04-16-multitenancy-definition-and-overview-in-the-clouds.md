So I was laying down by the river today in the sun and had a set of initial thoughts around defining and quantifying my tenancy within the cloud.

I really want to see my presence more defined so I have a better understanding and control. Here are some initial thoughts.

So my presence in the cloud usually is going to reside in a tenancy slot at on or more data centers, without getting too technical. Depending on the size and importance of my company or presence my tenancy will be of concern to several groups, and offer different perspectives:

  * **Client -** This is my perspective or the client who is leasing this service. This is probably one of the more important perspectives.
  * **Provider** \- This is the perspective of the service provider and what the client tenancy means to them.
  * **Partners -** This is the 3rd party view of my tenancy. I am hoping with my slot in the cloud I get some tools that allow me to interact with other 3rd party providers like using Google Secure Data Connect or an [application programming interface][1]. Hopefully I get a wealth of tools out of the box, but this interroperability is important to my tenancy.
  * **Public -** This is the public view of my tenancy. A [web site][2], wiki, [RSS feed][3]. Any way that the public can get a view of my tenancy / slot in the lcouds.
  * **Government -** This is a new area I am thinking about regarding how things are defined in the cloud for use by regulators and the government. Now for us very small businesses we are just a blip, but for larger more important companies like AIG or [CitiBank][4] there should be a definition of their tenancy that can be quantified. I am still flushing this out, but this would feed regulatory agencies, cyber police,
