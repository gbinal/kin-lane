    Joining the Conversation is one my new catch phrases.It just sounds good, and it really means so much to me in the 2.0 world.I have seen it so many places lately and describes so much about my
    approach to Social Media Marketing.Marketing these days is not about broadcasting our message to an audience, it is about joining the conversation.
