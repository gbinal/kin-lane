Joining the Conversation is one my new catch phrases. It just sounds good, and it really means so much to me in the 2.0 world.

I have seen it so many places lately and describes so much about my approach to [Social Media Marketing][1].

Marketing these days is not about broadcasting our message to an audience, it is about joining the conversation.

I have had lots of problems with business owners and clients not getting involved in their [web site development][2], [online marketing projects][3], and [social media campaigns][3]. They usually just say they don't understand it and want you to do it for them.

Joining the Conversation and requiring a site owner to get involved and provide regular interaction with site development and marketing efforts will be a common theme of mine in the future.

I just posted about gathering my comments and conversations as I place them using coComment and Firefox Add-on / Web Application combination.

Joining the conversation as part of a social media marketing campaign requires oversight and senior involvement from the client. The message has to be consistent and intelligent and have a voice.

The content you place on the Internet will stay there and represent you represent you and your company so it is a form of advertising as stated by Brian Clark of CopyBlogger in his blog [If Content is the New Advertising, What does your Advertising say about you?][4]

You have to put a lot of thought into that as you join the conversation.
