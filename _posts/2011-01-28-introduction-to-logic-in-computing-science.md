    This course is based on the following philosophical principle: All computing scientists must be able to employ rigorous reasoning to justifytheir claims about thebehaviorof the programs they
    produce.Thus the goal of this course is to introduce you to the logical and mathematical tools forreasoning about algorithms.Being able to e?ectively use these tools makes the di?erencebetween
    being a programming hack and a computing scientist.
