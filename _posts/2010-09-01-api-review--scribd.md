[<img class="alignnone c1" title="Scribd" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Scribd.PNG" alt="" width="132" height="46" align="right" />][1]I have been [reviewing a lot of APIs][2] lately. I"m evaluating their potential for integration into applications.

As I'm going through I"m also evaluating how they deliver their API community.

I was checking out the [Scribd API][1] tonight, and I like their delivery. Its pretty straightforward.

It has the following API building blocks:

  * API Overview
  * Sign Up for an API Account
  * API Tutorials
  * Client Libraries
  * User Authentication Overview
  * Usage Limits
  * Javascript API
  * Mobile and E-Reader API and SDK
  * Enterprise SDK
  * Help / Support
  * FAQ
They make it easy to sign up for an API account by providing links in navigation and on home page.

They provide client libraries in these programming language:

  * Ruby
  * Java
  * PHP
  * C# / .NET
  * ActionScript 3.0
  * Python
They just make it easy to get up and going by providing the necessary information and tools.

Its a good example to follow when deploying an API.
