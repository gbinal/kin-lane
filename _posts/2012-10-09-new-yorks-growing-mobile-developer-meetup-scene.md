I’m continuing my research into how various cities operate their developer meetups, with a focus on mobile developer gatherings. Today I’m focusing on New York City, a town that is fast becoming a contender with Silicon Valley for developer talent.

I went through the meetups for New York City and found the following mobile developer meetup groups:

  * [Android App Marketing][2] \- founded 09/07/2011, with 12 members, and 0 meetups so far
  * [Android Developer Workshop][3] \- founded 11/3/2010, with 124 members, and 3 meetups so far
  * [iPhone Developer Training][4] \- founded 05/12/2009, with 349 members, and 9 meetups so far
  * [iPhone Game Development NYC][5] \- founded 1/23/2010, with 270 members, and 2 meetups so far
  * [Mobile ][6]
