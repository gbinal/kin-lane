    I’m continuing my research into how various cities operate their developer meetups, with a focus on mobile developer gatherings.Today I’m focusing on New York City, a town that is fast becoming a
    contender with Silicon Valley for developer talent.I went through the meetups for New York City and found the following mobile developer meetup groups: Android App Marketing - founded 09/07/2011,
    with 12 members, and 0 meetups so far Android Developer Workshop - founded 11/3/2010, with 124 members, and 3 meetups so far iPhone Developer Training - founded 05/12/2009, with 349 members, and
    9 meetups so far iPhone Game Development NYC - founded 1/23/2010, with 270 members, and 2 meetups so far Mobile &amp; Emerging Tech NYC - founded 07/25/2012, with 140 members and 1 meetup so far
    New York iOS Developer Meetup - founded 04/20/2008, with 3,116 member, ad 44 meetups so far New York Weekend IPhone Programming Seminar - founded 09/20/2010, with 196 members, and 10 meetups so
    far NY App Meetup - founded 03/24/2010, with 217 members and 5 meetups so far NYC Mobile App Developers - founded 05/07/2010, with 639 members, and 10 meetups so far NYC Mobile Tech Meetup -
    founded 09/25/2011, with 203 members, and 1 meetup so far Queens iOS Developers Meetup - founded 06/07/2012, with 73 members, and 2 meetups so far While New York does not have the volume of
    members that San Francisco has, it is definitely a close second.I also notice that NYC has a couple more workshop, learning based meetups--which tells me the community identifies the need for
    ramping up new mobile developers, which seems crucial.Beyond that, the patterns seem similar to San Francisco.
