    People are always looking for proof that you can find work or business through social media marketing.Just like with traditional search engine marketing people are looking for the instant
    gratification.A click through conversion, etc.It takes a lot more work than that, it is a constant build and constant presence.I build relationships and connections each day hoping one of them
    will lead to my next big opportunity.
