    Just saw a commercial from Mountain Dew about their new soda creation web site, www.dewmocracy.com.It was another interesting usage of Social Media Marketing that utilizes its pro-users or
    audience to facilitate research and development (R&amp;D).They are encouraging customers to go to the web site and help decide certain characteristics of a new Mountain Dew soda.
