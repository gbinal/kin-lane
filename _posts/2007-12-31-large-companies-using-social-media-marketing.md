Just saw a commercial from Mountain Dew about their new soda creation web site, www.dewmocracy.com.It was another interesting usage of Social Media Marketing that utilizes its pro-users or audience to facilitate research and development (R&amp;D).    They are encouraging customers to go to the web site and help decide certain characteristics of a new Mountain Dew soda.It is a pretty simple web site surrounding a kind of game / soda creation application.  The site is built in .NET, the application looks like Silverlight, but I am not sure.Not really impressed with the campaign overall but it is an interesting usage of these new methods.  Shows that the big co's are embracing these principles, now we need to see more of it in the smaller business arena.
