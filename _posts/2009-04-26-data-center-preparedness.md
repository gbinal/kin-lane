{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have talked before about data centers supporting the cloud and green data center construction strategies.I have heard comments on the amount of data center infrastructure we have is adequate for the next round of cloud growth.I tend to be an optimist, but I think the next round of cloud adoption is going to be huge.When it matures and we see major Enterprise and Government adoption of the cloud we will see a huge demand for data centers.Also with the success of IPhone and others following suit such as Android, Blackberry, Vodafone, Nokia, and many others you will see a huge need for cloud data center capacity.</p>
