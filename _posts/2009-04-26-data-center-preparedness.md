I have talked before about [data centers][1] supporting the cloud and green data center construction strategies. I have heard comments on the amount of data center [infrastructure][2] we have is adequate for the next round of cloud growth.

I tend to be an optimist, but I think the next round of cloud adoption is going to be huge.

When it matures and we see major [Enterprise][3] and Government adoption of the cloud we will see a huge demand for data centers.

Also with the success of [IPhone][4] and others following suit such as [Android][5], Blackberry, [Vodafone][6], [Nokia][7], and many others you will see a huge need for cloud data center capacity.

I think you are going to see a major rollout of data center providers to support this growth.

I think congressional members and other state players need to have their plans in place. How can they court and meet the needs of these data center builders and [cloud service][8] providers?

Why should data centers be built in their state? What can they offer? Incentives, cheap power, cooling, etc.

States need to have their cloud and data center plans in place and this requires a lot of [education][9] and planning this area. We need to make sure the next round of data center growth is green and happens right here in the United States.

I already see a lot of buzz around other countries getting on board, lets not let them court all the data center developers and cloud providers.
