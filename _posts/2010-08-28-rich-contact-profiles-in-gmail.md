    In addition to adopting Gist, I have quickly adopted a new tool that shows you rich contact profiles right inside Gmail.It is called Rapportive.I have heard about them, and Audrey uses them, but
    until I watched them present at YC DemoDay it didnt really stick.As soon as I got home I installed Rapportive in Firefox and Chrome.Amazing!
