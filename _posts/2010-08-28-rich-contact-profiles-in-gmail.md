In addition to adopting Gist, I have quickly adopted a new tool that shows you rich contact profiles right inside Gmail. It is called Rapportive.
I have heard about them, and Audrey uses them, but until I watched them present at YC DemoDay it didn't really stick.
As soon as I got home I installed Rapportive in Firefox and Chrome. Amazing!
You get so much intelligence on each contact in your Gmail inbox. I started searching for old contacts just to see what it would show.
Rapportive is an essential tool in my social CRM toolbox.
