<img class="alignnone c1" title="Rapportive" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Rapportive.PNG" alt="" width="250" align="right" />In addition to [adopting Gist][1], I have quickly adopted a new tool that shows you [rich contact profiles right inside Gmail][2]. It is called [Rapportive][2].

I have heard about them, and [Audrey][3] uses them, but until I watched them present at [YC DemoDay][4] it didn't really stick.

As soon as I got home I installed [Rapportive][2] in Firefox and Chrome. Amazing!

You get so much intelligence on each contact in your Gmail inbox. I started searching for old contacts just to see what it would show.

[Rapportive][2] is an essential tool in my [social CRM][1] toolbox.
