    Was just checking out a cool service called doculicious.It allows people to create HTML forms that generate PDF and email them to you when the form is submitted.It is a inexpensive and easy way
    to collect users data and create a legible records of their information.They also provide a few other features: Email submission when forms are submitted Embed the forms in your own web site
    Export all data collected into popular formats Overall a pretty cool tool.I would say this web service falls under my category of doing one thing and doing it well.
