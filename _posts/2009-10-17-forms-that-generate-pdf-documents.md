Was just checking out a cool service called doculicious. It allows people to create HTML forms that generate PDF and email them to you when the form is submitted.
It is a inexpensive and easy way to collect users data and create a legible records of their information. They also provide a few other features:

	Email submission when forms are submitted
	Embed the forms in your own web site
	Export all data collected into popular formats

Overall a pretty cool tool. I would say this web service falls under my category of doing one thing and doing it well.
It is a simple tool that solves a problem well, and provides some added features allowing you to get maximum value.
