<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/government/SunlightFoundationLogo_500wide.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" />[Sunlight Foundation][1] sent out an update on [Data.gov, USASpending.gov and the IT Dashboard budget cuts][2] today.

Due to support of the Sunlight Foundation "Save the Data" campaign, the budget cuts were not as bad.

Instead of cutting from $34 million to $2 million, the budgets is being reduced to $8 million.

The Sunlight Foundation says, "we also have a pledge from Representative Issa, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, to make sure these transparency programs don't die".

There will be more chances to show support for these programs, with Congress considering a budget for 2012.

Sunlight Foundation needs everyone tol keep fighting to Save the Data and make sure these transparency programs don't fade away.

You can follow Sunlight's updates about[Save the Data][3] on their blog.
