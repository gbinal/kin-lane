    Just having a few thoughts tonight after reading several posts on statements made from Yahoo about the future of social networks being email based.Also did some more reading on OpenSocial
    tonight.It got me thinking about how I work on the computer everyday.All the tools I use to communicate, network and get my work and play accomplished.With the opening of networks, sharing of
    information, and applications becoming more modular things are really getting good.
