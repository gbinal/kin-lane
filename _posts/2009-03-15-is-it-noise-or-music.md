    I was driving home tonight from Eugene....it was a real quiet drive. About half way home I decided to turn on the radio. At first it all sounded like clutter and noise, not music. Then once my
    senses adjusted I was able to tell it was music. I was about to shut it off. I wonder how much else I shut off before I recognize its music.
