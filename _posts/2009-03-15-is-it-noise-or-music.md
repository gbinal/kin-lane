{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was driving home tonight from Eugene....it was a real quiet drive.
About half way home I decided to turn on the radio.
At first it all sounded like clutter and noise, not music.
Then once my senses adjusted I was able to tell it was music.
I was about to shut it off.
I wonder how much else I shut off before I recognize its music.</p>
