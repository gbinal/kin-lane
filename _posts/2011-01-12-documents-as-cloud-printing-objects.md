{% include JB/setup %}<p>I know very little about the Print industry.As Im learning I find myself applying my programming and IT background to everything.Currently Im prototyping a Cloud Print platform that provides 2 step commercial Printing service from top cloud service providers:

	Scribd
	Issuu
	Amazon S3
	Google Docs
	Box.net
	Dropbox

When a user comes from one of these cloud providers or provides a link to their document on the Cloud Storage platform they are bringing their content with them.I need a print object to apply to that content and create a printable document.</p>
