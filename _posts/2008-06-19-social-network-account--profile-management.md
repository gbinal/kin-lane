    We offer social network account and profile management to our clients on a regular basis.It is a lot of work to maintain your social network profile.I find I can spend a good hour a day on
    MySpace, Facebook, and LinkedIn for my own personal profile.I didnt even touch my other profiles such as Orkut, Bebo, Hi5, Mashables, Fast Company, and on and on.Just making sure your account is
    logged into everyday and your profile is fresh is a lot of work.
