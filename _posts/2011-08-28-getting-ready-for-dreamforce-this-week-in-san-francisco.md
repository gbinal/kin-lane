     I'm gearing up forSalesforce's cloud computing industry event, DreamForce, this week. The event, titled "Welcome to the Social Enterprise" is happening at Moscone Center August 30th through September 2nd. Couple of the talks I'm really looking forward to are Vivek Kundra, former CIO of the US, Marc Benioff the CEO of Salesforce.com, and Eric Schmidt the Executive Chariman of Googleï¿½.oh and of course Metallica!! I'm looking forward to exploring how APIs, and more specifically how print APIs contribute to this social enterprise, in this era of enterprise cloud computing. Look for me there, I'm the guy with theMimeo Cloud Print APIt-shirt. I'm easy to spot.
