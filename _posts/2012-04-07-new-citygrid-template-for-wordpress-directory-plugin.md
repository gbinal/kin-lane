    I just pushed an update for the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin.The Wordpress Plugin lets any Wordpress site owner to launch a business directory for their site, allowing them to choose
    the business categories they wish to display.For example, if you want to show pizza, burgers, seafood and chinese food in your neighborhood you can launch the plugin, choose your categories,
    enter your city, neighborhood or zip code and it automatically adds a directory to your menu with the categories you wish to display.The plugin has been around for a month, but it had a pretty
    basic look and feel, I wanted it to look better.Last week took the HTML and CSS template for&nbsp;CityGrid, cleaned it up and turned it into a&nbsp;template for any developer to use when
    deploying a local web directory.
