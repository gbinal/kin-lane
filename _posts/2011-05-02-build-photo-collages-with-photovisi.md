<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/other/PhotoVisi.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I was just playing with a cool new, free photo collage tool called [Photovisi][1].

With Photovisi you can select one of the many [layout designs][2], add your photos and then customize by dragging items around.

After the collage is finished, it's available for download as a .jpg file.

Once you download a photo collage, you can easily print by saving the .jpg as a .pdf using the [Mimeo Print Driver][3], then build posters and photo books using [Mimeo.com][4]

Photovisi also offers a [Facebook version of their collage application][5] for working with Facebook photos.
