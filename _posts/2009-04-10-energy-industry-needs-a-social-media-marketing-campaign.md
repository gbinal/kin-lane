    I was reading an article today in an old Time magazine about the energy industry, and then simultaneously I saw an ad from BP that showed the diversity of their approach and it included
    efficiencies as an option.This is what the Time magazine article was touting as the #1 energy solution for us.Efficiency.Definitely makes sense.Its a great idea, but how do you get people to
    change?
