{% include JB/setup %}<p>For some reason today I got a nervous feeling that I have too many Amazon EC2 instances up and running.I was up to 20 instances mid week to support our event in May.I shut them down 24 hours later, but for some reason I got worried that I had left some up and running.I have done this before.left an instance running a day or two longer than I should have.</p>
