    I am working to define a&nbsp;CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social stack, to help CityGrid developers more efficiently build web and mobile apps.This definition will contain APIs, tools, platforms and
    other data sets that can be used along with&nbsp;CityGrid Places,&nbsp;Offers,&nbsp;Reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;Advertising.I’m working my way through a bunch of tools and APIs for the local and mobile
    portion of the stack, but I find myself spinning when I’m trying to define the “social”.Obviously providing information on using the primary social networks in your apps is important: Facebook
    Social Graph API Twitter API Google+ API Foursquare API But where do we go next with social in our local mobile applications?We can find our friends, we can check-in and socially share what we
    are doing in our every day, local lives--but it seems like there is more that Im missing.
