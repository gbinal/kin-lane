    ATT decided to stop offering unlimited data plans to new customers today.Im going to ride the Anti ATT sentiment for a bit.I have several complaints about AT&amp;T that I need to explore here on
    my blog.I have had the phone number 541-913-2328 on the AT&amp;T network since January 1999.It was my primary business line for the eight years I ran a web application development company.
