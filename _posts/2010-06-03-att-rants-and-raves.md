{% include JB/setup %}<p>ATT decided to stop offering unlimited data plans to new customers  today.Im going to ride the Anti ATT sentiment for a bit.I  have several complaints about AT&amp;T that I need to explore here on my  blog.I have had the phone number 541-913-2328 on the  AT&amp;T network since January 1999.It was my primary business line  for the eight years I ran a web application development company.</p>
