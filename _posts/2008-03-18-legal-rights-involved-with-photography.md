    I enjoy taking pictures of anything and everything. I am always curious about the legal rights of taking pictures of people and places.<br />
    <br />
    I just read a great post called <a href="http://photojojo.com/content/tips/legal-rights-of-photographers/">Photography and The Law: Know Your Rights</a> which contained the <a href=
    "http://photojojo.com/content/tips/legal-rights-of-photographers/">The Ten Legal Commandments of Photography</a>.<br />
    <br />
    It has great information about some common misconceptions surrounding the legalities of taking pictures of people and places.
