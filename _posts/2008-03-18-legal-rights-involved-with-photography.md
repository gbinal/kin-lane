    I enjoy taking pictures of anything and everything.I am always curious about the legal rights of taking pictures of people and places.I just read a great post called Photography and The Law: Know
    Your Rights which contained the The Ten Legal Commandments of Photography.It has great information about some common misconceptions surrounding the legalities of taking pictures of people and
    places.
