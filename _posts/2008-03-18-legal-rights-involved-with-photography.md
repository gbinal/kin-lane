I enjoy taking pictures of anything and everything. I am always curious about the legal rights of taking pictures of people and places.

I just read a great post called [Photography and The Law: Know Your Rights][1] which contained the [The Ten Legal Commandments of Photography][1].

It has great information about some common misconceptions surrounding the legalities of taking pictures of people and places.
