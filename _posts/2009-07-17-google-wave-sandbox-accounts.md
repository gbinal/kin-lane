    I received a Google Wave Sandbox account because I attended the Google IO Conference back in May. They have limited access to the API and Sandbox until it stabilized. I was reading their blog
    today and they are going to <a href="http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-wave-sandbox-update.html">open up the Google Wave API</a> to many people who have submitted their requests.
    So if you haven't requested access, make sure you do. And let them know your plans, it will influence their decision.
