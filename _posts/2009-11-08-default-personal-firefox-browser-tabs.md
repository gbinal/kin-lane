When I start my day I tend to open one browser and deploy all my work / business related applications and one browser for all my personal related applications.
My personal browser tabs have been:

	Gmail
	Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar
	Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning
	Facebook
	Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)

It has been this way for a while. I am now noticing a new shift in my personal default browser setup. I am seeing the following apps:

	Gmail
	Google Voice
	Google Wave
	Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar
	Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning
	Facebook
	LinkedIn
	Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)

This is just what I have open by default in my Firefox browser. There are more tools I use as desktop apps as well as apps for the business.
I will work on outlining these later.
