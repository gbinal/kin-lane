{% include JB/setup %}<p>Was just checking out Guy Kawasaki's latest project Alltop.The site layout instantly sucked me in.Couldn't get past the grey bar layer at first.   Actually after i got over it....it forced me to really focus on the content.....interesting approach.The sites that are already in my sights within the categories I care about were nothing new.  However the introduction to a few new categories was nice.Fresh information....fresh approach.Thanks.</p>
