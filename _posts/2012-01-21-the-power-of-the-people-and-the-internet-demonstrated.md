      A recent image from <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/sopa/">ProPublica.org</a> demonstrates the power of the people via the Internet, when it came to influencing our Government.
      &nbsp;The image shows which members of Congress changed their position after the blackout protest of January 18, 2012. &nbsp;

      This shift, demonstrates the power we the people have via the Internet and how important it is that we protect this right, and keep the Internet open and freely accessible to everyone. &nbsp;
