{% include JB/setup %}<p>As I prepare to go to Washington DC, to work with the Department of Veterans Affiars (VA), Im spending a lot of time thinking about how Ill prepare for my year, working within the federal government.&nbsp;
While working for the White House, and at the VA, will most definitely be an entirely new experience for me, I feel my approach and experience within the API space will benefit me greatly.&nbsp;
When it comes to the tech, business and politics of APIs I dont see things as:



black#000000
&nbsp;



OR



white#FFFFFF
&nbsp;



I see things as grey, and try to empathize and understand with all the shades of grey:

This iapproach to monitoring the API universe has allowed me to better understand the differences between APIs and the companie or individauls behind them.&nbsp;
I feel this will help me understand how Washington works, and continue to find, simple, meaningful, API driven approaches to helping our government innovate.</p>
