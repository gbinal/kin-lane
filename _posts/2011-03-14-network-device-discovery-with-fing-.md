</p>

<p>
     I want something that will run at the command line on multiple platforms.
</p>

<p>
     I came across<a title="Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">Fing from Overlook</a>.
</p>

<p>
     Fing is acommand line tool for <a title="Network and Service Discovery" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/">network and service discovery.</a>
</p>

<p>
     It can detect wireless and wired devices.
</p>

<p>
     It saves network device discovery results to a log file or to a CSV format.
</p>

<p>
     Fing runs on Windows Linux and Mac. You can <a title="Download Fing" href="http://www.over-look.com/site/index.php/download">download Fing</a> from the Overlook site..
