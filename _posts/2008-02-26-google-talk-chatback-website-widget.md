{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just playing with the new Google Talk Chatback Widget.It allows you to allow anonymous chats from your web page for your customers and site visitors.I was just researching using this last week for a client who was asking for it and didnt much care for the Boldchat they were using.It is a great FREE or low cost web site chat and support module.Just yet another innovative use for the Google Platform.</p>
