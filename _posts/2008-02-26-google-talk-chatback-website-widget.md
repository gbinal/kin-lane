{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just playing with the new Google Talk Chatback Widget.  It allows you to allow anonymous chats from your web page for your customers and site visitors. I was just researching using this last week for a client who was asking for it and didn't much care for the Boldchat they were using.It is a great FREE or low cost web site chat and support module.  Just yet another innovative use for the Google Platform.  I use the Google services for so much these days.I went ahead and added to my web site, since I leave my Gmail open all day and live in my Google Desktop it was a natural fit to have on my blog.</p>
