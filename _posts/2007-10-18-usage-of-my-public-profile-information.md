    Since everything with my public profile is accessible to the general public in some form, there should be a easy profile page get at my bio and display links to all my public information.<br />
    <br />
    You should be able to see my photos, videos, comments, social networks, etc.<br />
    <br />
    Of course the ones I want you to see.<br />
    <br />
    You should be able to review my resume and work / project history. You should know if I am looking for work or not.<br />
    <br />
    All of this without really speaking to me. However, you should be able to interact with me as well.<br />
    <br />
    People should be able to come get my information from me.<br />
    <br />
    If I am selling products or offering services you should see that. Come harvest my public events. Come gather demographics on me.<br />
    <br />
    If you like a video I have you can license it right there and utilize it.
