Since everything with my public profile is accessible to the general public in some form, there should be a easy profile page get at my bio and display links to all my public information.You should be able to see my photos, videos, comments, social networks, etc.Of course the ones I want you to see.You should be able to review my resume and work / project history.  You should know if I am looking for work or not.All of this without really speaking to me.  However, you should be able to interact with me as well.People should be able to come get my information from me.If I am selling products or offering services you should see that. Come harvest my public events. Come gather demographics on me.If you like a video I have you can license it right there and utilize it.
