    Since everything with my public profile is accessible to the general public in some form, there should be a easy profile page get at my bio and display links to all my public information.You
    should be able to see my photos, videos, comments, social networks, etc.Of course the ones I want you to see.You should be able to review my resume and work / project history.You should know if I
    am looking for work or not.
