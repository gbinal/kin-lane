{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just talking about using Amazon for backing up your data in the clouds.One feature that Amazon introduced recently was version control for Amazon S3 data.You can use Amazon S3 versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every  version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.This allows  you to easily recover from both unintended user actions and application  failures.By default, requests will retrieve the most recently written  version.</p>
