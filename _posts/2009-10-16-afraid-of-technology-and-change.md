    As a technology leader I face a lot of resistance from employers, partners and co-workers regarding the usage of new technology.I spent a great deal of time each day reading technical blogs and
    learning about new technologies.I test drive new tools and applications almost daily to see what is out there and the benefit they offer.I am always very cautious about whether a new application,
    service or tool will actually add value to a company and its process.This are can really be a double edge sword.
