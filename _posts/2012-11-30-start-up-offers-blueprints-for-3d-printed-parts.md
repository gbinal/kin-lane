     I read a great post recently about how a company called Teenage Engineering has started providing 3D CAD files that allow their customers to 3D print replacement parts for the products they make. It is awesome to see things I talk about become reality.  I wrote about the concept of a 3D printed junk drawer last year, while doing research on 3D printing and APIs. Teenage Engineering is taking a big step, and potentially leading the industry in new ways.  Can you imagine if companies by default, provide 3D drawings of common replacement parts and pieces for their products? There is still a lot of gaps in how all of this can work, 3D printing is widely available yet, but with retailers like Staples playing around with offering 3D printing on demand, the future for 3D printing is looking pretty bright.
