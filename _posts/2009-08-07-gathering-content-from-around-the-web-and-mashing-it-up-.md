I just answered a question for someone on the best screen scraping, data gathering, mashup tools out there. I couldn't remember the name of dapper for the life of me.
So I figured I would record here so I could find in the future. Love my blog for that.
With these tools below I can usually put together a quick content scraping, mash up and general re purposing of content tool job or utility.
