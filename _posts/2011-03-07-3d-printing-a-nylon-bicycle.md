Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic.<p></p>
The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern. Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed.<p></p>
Its just a prototype of whats possible with current <a title="3D Printing and Manufacturing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3D printing and manufacturing technology</a>.<p></p>
Here are some other things I've seen come off the 3D assembly line lately:

</ul>
It seems like every week I'm seeing something new in the 3D printing and manufacturing space.<p></p>
3D printing combined with web APIs are going to revolutionize manufacturing in the next couple years.
