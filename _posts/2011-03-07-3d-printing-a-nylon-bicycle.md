     Engineers in the UK are using 3D printing with a nylon powder to create a really cool, futuristic bicycle. Guided by a computer-aided design program, a laser fuses together several layers of finely powdered metal, nylon or plastic. The laser melts the powder, which solidifies according to a chosen pattern. Then more powder is added, melting and solidifying to add layer upon layer until the object is fully formed. Its just a prototype of whats possible with current 3D printing and manufacturing technology. Here are some other things I've seen come off the 3D assembly line lately: Space Stations Architecture Body Parts Food It seems like every week I'm seeing something new in the 3D printing and manufacturing space. 3D printing combined with web APIs are going to revolutionize manufacturing in the next couple years.
