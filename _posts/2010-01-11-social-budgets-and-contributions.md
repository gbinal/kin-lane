    Many projects I do in my spare time are purely for the exercise and learning experience. I have been developing a tool I am calling social budgets. I am very political, but I get frustrated when
    I don't fully understand what is going on at a state and federal level. I like to have a deep understanding before I take action or even open my mouth. So I wanted to understand where the State
    of Oregon is spending their money and create a way I can voice my opinion on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> priorities. So I created an <a href=
    "http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/">Oregon Social Budget</a> site. The next day I saw California released their budget, so I wanted to evaluate their budget and created a <a href=
    "http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/">California Social Budget</a> site. What did I learn?
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>I learned about the ways that Oregon and California track their budget.
      </li>
      <li>How they spend and prioritize these budgets.
      </li>
      <li>I learned that even though governments are using the word "transparency", they don't actually make it any easier to get at the data.
      </li>
      <li>I learned about new agencies and commissions that operate at the state level.
      </li>
    </ul>It has been fun so far. I am pushing my knowledge of government operations and building a cool little social tool. I want to keep working on the tool and evolve it, so I am looking into
    other potential uses.
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Federal Budget Priorities
      </li>
      <li>Congressional and Senator Contribution Tool
      </li>
    </ul>Any other ideas? We'll see how much time I have.
