{% include JB/setup %}<p>Twitter released a brand new twitter.com today with all kinds of new features.The feature that really stands out for me is now the main twitter.com web site runs off the Twitter API.The Twitter mobile site and Twitter Iphone and IPad apps all run using the Twitter API, but now the most popular Twitter client does as well.</p>
