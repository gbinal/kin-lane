{% include JB/setup %}<p>I stumbled across Google Refine yesterday while writing a story on a Famers Market API.Google Refine is the rebirth of what was formerly known as Freebase Gridworks, in which Google picked up in their 2010 acquisition of Metaweb.Google Refine is a powerful desktop tool for cleaning up, refining and normalizing datasets on your desktop.Some of the tools it provides out of the box Ive spent months writing custom scripts to do, and its all available through a web-based GUI interface.Google Refine isnt just for cleaning up messy data, you can also use to transform data that you gathered or harvested and normalize into standard, tabular data sets you can use in other system.</p>
