    I know Ive ranted about this before, but here we go again.It cannot be said enough.EVERY business that has a web site and has information on the Internet needs to provide RSS Feeds for that
    data.I am looking for product review web sites right now.Looking to harvest data on different product areas and feed it back out to users.
