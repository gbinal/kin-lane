    Google Gears or the Offline Settings is what had screwed up my Gmail (Google Apps) left hand menu bar.I just turned offline off for Gmail and my menu went back to normal.Well that is a big
    deterrent for me to use the offline settings, for some reason it just made me angry to look at the screen when it was all jacked up.
