    Im playing around with Visual.ly, a infographics and data visualizations marketplace and builder that just launched.Infographics and data visualizations are a great way to experience stories and
    create a new way of seeing the world of data, one that helps communicate complex ideas in a clear and beautiful way.Visual.ly has collected the best examples on the web and organized them in a
    single directory for discovery, publishing and sharing.
