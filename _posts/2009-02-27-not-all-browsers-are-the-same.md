{% include JB/setup %}<p>As part of my 3rd party service development plan for my company I make recommendations for external systems that my company should be using for its operations.We dont buy or develop everything internally.There are some amazing 3rd party applications.A couple notable ones are:

	Gmail / Google Apps for Your Domain
	Google Docs
	Google Calendar
	Email Center Pro (ECP)

These are applications that I have integrated heavily into our daily operations.Another characteristic they all have is they are heavy JavaScript based applications.</p>
