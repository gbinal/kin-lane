    Users are quickly moving into the drivers seat when it comes to determining how a web application should look, feel and function.Take the recent Facebook revolt where users banded together and
    made it clear that they do not like the new Facebook layout.I dont think this was a single case where you have such a passionate base of users that they made their voice heard.I think this is the
    beginning of a trend.I feel that application and cloud developers need to start building into their development cycle the integration of their users and their feedback.
