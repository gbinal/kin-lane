{% include JB/setup %}All right I have a couple of new Google Features for Google Docs tonight.  In addition to Taking an ordered list in Google Docs and highlighting and publish as a Google Presentation, I would like another one:I am working about 40+ documents in Google Docs right now.  I would like to share them all with someone and have them help me work on some and generally allow them to acess them.So what do I have to do?  I have to go through each Google Doc and share it with this contact.It would be much easier if I could just share them with a group.
