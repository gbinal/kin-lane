    All right I have a couple of new Google Features for Google Docs tonight.In addition to Taking an ordered list in Google Docs and highlighting and publish as a Google Presentation, I would like
    another one:I am working about 40+ documents in Google Docs right now.I would like to share them all with someone and have them help me work on some and generally allow them to acess them.So what
    do I have to do?I have to go through each Google Doc and share it with this contact.
