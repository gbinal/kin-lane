<img class="alignnone c1" title="Sencha" src="http://www.sencha.com/assets/images/logo-sencha-sm.png" alt="" width="120" height="50" align="right" />The [ExtJS team is really excited about HTML 5][1]. They see HTML 5 as the future. I definitely agree. [Ext JS][2], [jQTouch][3], and [Raphaï¿½l][4] are combining into a new entity called [Sencha][5].

I have used [Ext JS][2] for several web applications and internal adminstration systems. It is one of my favorite JavaScript frameworks that I keep coming back to.

I'm excited to see them fully embracing HTML5. One thing I really enjoy about [Ext JS][2] is that I don't have to think about the presentation layer much. They just deliver.

They have been showcasing their support for HTML 5 also in a flurry of blog posts:

  * [HTML5, Video, Canvas, and Ext JS][6]
  * [A HTML5 Primer for the Overwhelmed][7]
  * [The HTML5 Family: Web Storage][8]
  * [The HTML5 Family: CSS3][9]
  * [The HTML5 Family: Web Workers][10]
  * [The HTML5 Family: Geolocation][11]
  * [HTML5 Is Here Now][12]
Then finally with the release of [Sencha Touch, an HTML5 Framework for Mobile][13]. As they state:

_**Sencha Touch is the world's first app framework built specifically to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript for the highest level of power, flexibility, and optimization.**_ The initial beta supports IPhone and Android and delivers enhanced touch effects and data request using Ajax, JSONp, or YQL and takes advantage of [HTML5 Local Storage][14].

Exciting to see not only HTML5 beings upported, but a mobile application framework. I will definitely be watching [Sencha][15] alongside my other HTML 5 research.
