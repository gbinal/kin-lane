[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/flickr.jpg" alt="" width="140" align="right" />][1]This code sample is something you can find easily on the Internet, but I want to include it in my series about creating a photo book with Flickr.

Its easy to pull photos from [Flickr][1], all you need is a [Flickr API][2] key and the [Zend Framework][3].

Notice I use the tags argument to filter my search.

In this particular case I'm pulling photos that are tagged "Instagram App" because I want only photos I've taken with [Instagram][4] on my IPhone.

Next I will be creating a layout for a photo book, using my [Instagram][4] photos from [Flickr][5].
