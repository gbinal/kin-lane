{% include JB/setup %}This code sample is something you can find easily on the Internet, but I want to include it in my series about creating a photo book with Flickr.
Its easy to pull photos from Flickr, all you need is a Flickr API key and the Zend Framework.
 Notice I use the tags argument to filter my search.    
In this particular case I'm pulling photos that are tagged "Instagram App" because I want only photos I've taken with Instagram on my IPhone.
Next I will be creating a layout for a photo book, using my Instagram photos from Flickr.
