{% include JB/setup %}<p>After I deal with all emails, fires, top requests, and spend a large amount of time on all my top projects I try to work on areas that are going to move my company forward.Creating a presence on the Internet is priority one.WebEvents Global is 10 years old, has a very mature software package, and handles some large events for prominent names such as SAP, Google, Schwab.However our web presence is non-existent.The event planning industry is a very incestual industry where most people know each other and most referrals are through word of mouth.</p>
