[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/photo-book/css-polaroid-photo-layout.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" />][1]I'm working on several print photobook projects right now and I'm always on the lookout for good CSS photo layouts.

I came across a very well done tutorial called, [How To Create a Pure CSS Polaroid Photo Gallery][2].

I have modified somewhat for use as a photo book template, and published @ [Github][3].

I will be using this layout for several blog posts to come on building photo books with Flickr, Instagram and other photo sharing tools
