{% include JB/setup %}<p>I'm working on several print photobook projects right now and I'm always on the lookout for good CSS photo layouts.
I came across a very well done tutorial called, How To Create a Pure CSS Polaroid Photo Gallery.
I have modified somewhat for use as a photo book template, and published @ Github.

I will be using this layout for several blog posts to come on building photo books with Flickr, Instagram and other photo sharing tools
