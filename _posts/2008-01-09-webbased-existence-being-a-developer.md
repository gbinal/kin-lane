So in the last year I have completely move online. Everything I do is web-based. Most of my world exists underneath my Google Account.

However I use many other web services to get done what I do everyday. I can sit down at any computer pretty much and access my world online and get busy.

One area I am lacking is a web-based code editor to manage develop my sites and web applications. I utilize the OWS Architecture for managing a lot of the content on our sites and [build out our dynamic web sites using a CMS system][1].

Though when it comes to building applications and writing code I really don't have many options. So recently I found a [Edit Area a free web-based Javascript Editor][2].

The main features are:


  * Easy to integrate, only one script include and one function call
  * Tabulation support (allow to write well formated source code)
  * Search and replace (with regexp)
  * Customizable real-time syntax highlighting (currently: PHP, CSS, Javascript, Python, HTML, XML, VB, C, CPP, Pascal, Basic, Brainf*ck)
  * Auto-indenting new lines
  * Line numerotation
  * Multilanguage support (currently: Croatian, Danish, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese)
  * Possible PHP gzip compression (compress the 12 core files to one file of ~20Ko)
  * Allow multiple instances
  * Full screen mode
  * Possible plugin integration
  * Possible save and load callback functions
  * Possible dynamic content management
  * Can work in the same environment than "protype" and "mootools"'s like libraries.
So I am going to start integrating it into some of my work and servers. I will let you guys know how it goes. It will be nice to have this last piece of my world moved online.
