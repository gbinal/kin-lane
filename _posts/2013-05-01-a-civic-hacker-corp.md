    Ive always been told, If You Dont Vote, You Cant Bitch.This is a statement Ive heard from hundreds of American citizens that Ive encountered throughout my life, across every region of this great
    country.While I agree with the intent of this statement, I have to declare that it isnt enough!Its obvious that being a couch political pundit and voting for your favorite, corporate owned
    politician isnt enough anymore.In the age of the Internet, open data and open APIs we need politicking to be a group sport.
