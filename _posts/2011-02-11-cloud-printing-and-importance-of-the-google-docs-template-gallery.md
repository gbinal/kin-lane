    As Im planning and developing around the Google Cloud Print platform Im starting to see a bigger picture.If Google Docs becomes a central point of storage and printing via cloud printers, its
    value in the print supply chain becomes extremely valuable.If your creating, sharing, collaborating, storing and printing documents both personally and commercially using Google Docs, this
    increases the need for higher quality Google Doc templates.Google Docs Templates is an assortment of documents, spreadsheets, presentations and drawings in various categories such as legal,
    business and statistics.Even with the ability to rank Google Doc templates, the directory is a mess of very poor quality randomness that people decided to submit as templates.
