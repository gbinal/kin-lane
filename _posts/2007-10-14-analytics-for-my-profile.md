I have this great public profile showing all my stuff.

Now of course I want analytics for all of this. I want to know who is looking at what. What is most popular and what is not.

Show me which images were looked at today, what audio people heard.

I want to be able to do this all without having to grab a piece of code from my Google analytics and paste it on a site.

I just want to know.
