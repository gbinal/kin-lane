    I have this great public profile showing all my stuff.<br />
    <br />
    Now of course I want analytics for all of this. I want to know who is looking at what. What is most popular and what is not.<br />
    <br />
    Show me which images were looked at today, what audio people heard.<br />
    <br />
    I want to be able to do this all without having to grab a piece of code from my Google analytics and paste it on a site.<br />
    <br />
    I just want to know.
