    Everyone is talking about cloud computing these days in the tech industry.I just stopped doing some more work on a comprehensive list of cloud computing service providers.One of the key
    components of cloud computing is scalable, pay for what you use computing utilities.When are we going to get cloud internet connectivity.Sure I can buy connectivity in a collocation facility that
    will give me a burst able T1 which will allow me to go over and I pay overage charges.
