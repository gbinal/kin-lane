When I start working I tend to open a handful of work-based applications that I need open all the time while I work. A few of the must have applications are:

  * Google Home Page
  * GMail
  * Google Calendar
  * Eclipse
  * SQL Server Manager
  * Remote Desktop
A few applications that I open up that are not critical, but allow me to communicate and manage my network are:
  * Skype
  * Windows Live Messenger
  * Yahoo
  * Facebook
  * Myspace
  * LinkedIn
  * Twitter
Just shows how some applicaitons become business critical for me and others are not. Seems I could get more done business wise within my Facebook or LinkedIn profiles.

Need more applications and tools for doing this.
