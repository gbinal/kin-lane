    When I start working I tend to open a handful of work-based applications that I need open all the time while I work. A few of the must have applications are:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Google Home Page
      </li>
      <li>GMail
      </li>
      <li>Google Calendar
      </li>
      <li>Eclipse
      </li>
      <li>SQL Server Manager
      </li>
      <li>Remote Desktop
      </li>
    </ul>A few applications that I open up that are not critical, but allow me to communicate and manage my network are:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Skype
      </li>
      <li>Windows Live Messenger
      </li>
      <li>Yahoo
      </li>
      <li>Facebook
      </li>
      <li>Myspace
      </li>
      <li>LinkedIn
      </li>
      <li>Twitter
      </li>
    </ul>Just shows how some applicaitons become business critical for me and others are not. Seems I could get more done business wise within my Facebook or LinkedIn profiles. Need more applications
    and tools for doing this.
