     When I start working I tend to open a handful of work-based applications that I need open all the time while I work. A few of the must have applications are:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google Home Page
     </li>

     <li>GMail
     </li>

     <li>Google Calendar
     </li>

     <li>Eclipse
     </li>

     <li>SQL Server Manager
     </li>

     <li>Remote Desktop
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     A few applications that I open up that are not critical, but allow me to communicate and manage my network are:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Skype
     </li>

     <li>Windows Live Messenger
     </li>

     <li>Yahoo
     </li>

     <li>Facebook
     </li>

     <li>Myspace
     </li>

     <li>LinkedIn
     </li>

     <li>Twitter
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     Just shows how some applicaitons become business critical for me and others are not. Seems I could get more done business wise within my Facebook or LinkedIn profiles. Need more applications and tools for doing this.
