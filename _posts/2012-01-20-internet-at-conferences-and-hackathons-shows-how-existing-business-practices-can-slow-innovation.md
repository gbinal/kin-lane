    I was at the Facebook Mobile Hackathon&nbsp;at a hotel in Boston today, and during the event the Internet started going in and out, and eventually stopped working.Since every demo was using the
    Facebook platform they required live Internet.It basically brought things to a screeching halt, when nobody could present, or hack.This was a small event, but it hurts just as bad, no matter the
    event size.It happens at most events I attend, no matter the size.
