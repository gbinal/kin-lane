    Was just reading some of Now is Gone by Geoff Livingston.There is a great paragraph I just came across that really sums up a lot for me:Companies and organizations should look at social networks
    as a way to engage potential community members outside of the confines of a corporate URL.By participating intelligently and building value, a company can create a great conversation with its
    constituents as well as future customers.Further, they can encourage them to take actions and engage them within the confines of the companys own social media initiative.This really covers the
    essence of where a social media campaign should operate; outside the corporate URL.
