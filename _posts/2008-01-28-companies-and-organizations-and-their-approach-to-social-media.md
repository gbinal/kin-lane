    Was just reading some of Now is Gone by Geoff Livingston. There is a great paragraph I just came across that really sums up a lot for me:<br />
    <br />
    Companies and organizations should look at social networks as a way to engage potential community members outside of the confines of a corporate URL. By participating intelligently and building
    value, a company can create a great conversation with its constituents as well as future customers. Further, they can encourage them to take actions and engage them within the confines of the
    company's own social media initiative.<br />
    <br />
    This really covers the essence of where a social media campaign should operate; outside the corporate URL.<br />
    <br />
    Its not just directly with your customers, but with your future customers.<br />
    <br />
    Some of these concepts are very tough for traditional PPC marketers to grasp and directly measure the ROI.
