    This is a second post in a series about where cloud computing is headed.In addition to regional cloud computing centers, the need for raw cloud storage is growing.A handful of providers are
    leading the charge in cloud compute Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Amazon Web Services Rackspace Cloud These two are the undisputed leaders in delivering this new cloud computing utility.The
    other day Rackspace open sourced their cloud object storage software under the OpenStack: OpenStack Object Storage aggregates commodity servers to work together in clusters for reliable,
    redundant, and large-scale storage of static objects.Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the datacenter, with the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
    integrity across the cluster.
