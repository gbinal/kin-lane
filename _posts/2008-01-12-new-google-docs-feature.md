{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been using Google Notebook pretty heavily.I use it for about 80% of my data gathering in combination with the Google Notebook Firefox Add-on.I have permanent and temporary Google Notebook Folders for different purposes.I will export a notebook from a Google Notebook to Google Docs using the export feature available in the top right corner under tools.It really helps me internally publish gathered information to allow it to be more refined using Google Docs.</p>
