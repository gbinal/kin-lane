    A project Im moving off the back-burner and into the public domain is a project I called Tech Job Analysis.I have been pulling all the job postings in the three technical categories from
    Craigslist for all the North American and European job markets.I started pulling these RSS feeds and monitoring for the next dream job.which I got.Then I quickly started seeing other value in
    this data.
