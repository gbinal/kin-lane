<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/intersect-apigee-explorer.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />REST is simplifying APIs. Its opening up APIs to casual developers and beyond.

Recently [Google][1] and [Apigee][2] have released API explorers. These tools allow easy exploration of RESTful interfaces.

REST exploration tools like Apigee Console, make APIs accesible by more than developers.

One example I came across recently is [Intersect][3] by[@abraham][4].

[Intersect][3] is an API to get common friends, followers, and friends following from two Twitter accounts.

[@abraham][4] embedded an [Apigee API explorer][5] for playing with Interesect.

With an Apigee Explorer any user can quickly change values in a query string and return data from the IntersectAPI.

We are entering a phase where APIs are available beyond just the development community, and accessible to a wider audience.
