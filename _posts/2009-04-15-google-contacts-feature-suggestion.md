    I have had my Gmail account since the early days. I begged people to give me invites and finally got one. Ohhhh the early days. So my contact list is pretty large, and now that Google has
    expanded it beyond just a list of email addresses into an actual contact management system. It is pretty simple, but you can actually do a lot with it. I have been working to clean up my contact
    system and really start using it as a CRM. I really like that I can see the conversation history of people and remember who they are sometimes. I would like to suggest a really simple notes
    feature in the Google Contacts. So when someone emails me I can put more context into the relationship beyond actual emails, texts, or chats that I've had with that person. Just a suggestion
    Google, some notes please in Google Contacts.
