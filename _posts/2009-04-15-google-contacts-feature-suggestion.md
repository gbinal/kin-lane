    I have had my Gmail account since the early days.I begged people to give me invites and finally got one.Ohhhh the early days.So my contact list is pretty large, and now that Google has expanded
    it beyond just a list of email addresses into an actual contact management system.It is pretty simple, but you can actually do a lot with it.
