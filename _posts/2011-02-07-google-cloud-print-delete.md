     Now that you have a Google Cloud Printer registered with the Google Cloud Print (GCP) registry, at some point you will need to remove that printer from a users GCP registry. After authenticating using Google ClientLogin API, you can then delete an existing Google Cloud Printer: The Google Cloud Print /delete endpoint accepts the following parameter: printerid - Unique printer identification (generated by Google Cloud Print). Here is an example JSON response: The Google Cloud Printer will now be removed from a users Google Cloud Print (GCP) registry. They will no longer see cloud printer in their Google Apps cloud printer list, and will have to choose to add printer back.
