    Im enjoying learning about HTML 5.I havent been this excited about HTML since 1995(well maybe the day I actually understood the DOM also).I recently played around with the HTML5 Local Web Storage
    and HTML5 Web SQL Database in a HTML local contact management prototype I am building.As Im learning about the other features of HTML5 I will document the best learning tools here: HTML Info
    Graphic - An excellent visual walking you through HTML 5.Dive Into HTML 5 - A regular novel on HTML 5.
