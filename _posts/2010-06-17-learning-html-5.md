I'm enjoying learning about HTML 5. I haven't been this excited about HTML since 1995(well maybe the day I actually understood the DOM also). I recently played around with the [HTML5 Local Web Storage][1] and [HTML5 Web SQL Database][2] in a [HTML local contact management prototype][3] I am building.

As I'm learning about the other features of HTML5 I will document the best learning tools here:

  * **[HTML Info Graphic**][4] \- An excellent visual walking you through HTML 5.
  * **[Dive Into HTML 5][5]** \- A regular novel on HTML 5. Still working through this one.
  * **[HTML5 Tutorial][6]** \- Getting Started - This covers the basics of an HTML 5 document.
  * **[A Preview of HTML 5][7]** \- Walks through the HTML document, video and audio, and document representation.
  * **[What Does It All Mean?][8]** \- This one really dives in deep to the HTML 5 document and the semantics of HTML 5. I will be reading this one over and over.
  * **[HTML 5 Demos and Examples][9]** \- Some great functional introductions to HTML 5. I like it because it included functional HTML5 as well as the visual eye candy.
  * **[HTML 5 Local Storage][10]** \- Diving more into the functional. Which I like.
  * **[HTML 5 Canvas Cheat Sheet][11]** \- Cheat sheets are always handy.
  * **[HTML 5 Cheat Sheet][12]** \- A cheat sheet for the wall.
As with the number of programming languages I've learned over the years, I don't learn fully until I get actual projects under my belt. I'm focused on learning the functional sides of HTML 5 before I dive into the visual eye candy. I will keep working on my HTML local storage prototypes. Although I know Audrey will want a player for our music stored on the Amazon S3 cloud before much longer.
