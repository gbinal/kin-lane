    I was reading John Udells post on Managing Service Relationships, talks about managing your service profiles and choosing to receive or not receive paper bills, renewing your accounts etc.I have
    pondered this on several levels and thought about how nice it would be to have an application that would aggregate all your relationships under one interface.So this is really an application that
    could be offered on 2 levels.Personal Service Relationship Manager - Would allow me to track all my service relationships that I enter into.So this would go beyond managing my login information
    across networks like with OpenID.
