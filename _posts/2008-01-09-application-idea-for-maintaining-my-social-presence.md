    I have sen talk about maintaining the information you post all over the Internet and how people really dont think about the value of the information they have on the sites they use daily.If you
    spend most of your time on Facebook and you have a history of your friends and daily interactions for your entire time at college.This is valuable, you may not think about this now, but when you
    are 35 and are looking back, the value will be huge!What happens if they shut down your account.All this information is lost.
