    A recent post called, How Cloud Computing is transforming global business really spoke to me.It was a very clear list of important factors on how Cloud Computing is transforming business.I would
    like to take the time and analyze each point in the post: Government adoption: The federal government should become an early adopter and fund research.It can also accelerate competitive forces by
    insisting on standards to enhance privacy, security, openness, sustainability and interoperability.Government has to lead the way on this.
