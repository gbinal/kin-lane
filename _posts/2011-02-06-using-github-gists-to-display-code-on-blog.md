    Sometimes you notice things on the Internet and they just dont register for a while.Ive seen many sites displaying their code samples using a Gist by Github, but it hasnt really registered in my
    head for some reason.I even created a custom snippet of code the other day for displaying code in myWordpress blog.The other day I was going through Mashapes documentation and their use of Gist
    for their PHP API examples finally hit home.Gist is a simple way to share snippets of code with others.
