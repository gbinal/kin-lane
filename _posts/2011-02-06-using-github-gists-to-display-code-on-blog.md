Sometimes you notice things on the Internet and they just don't register for a while. I've seen many sites displaying their code samples using a [Gist by Github][1], but it hasn't really registered in my head for some reason. [<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-gist.png" alt="" align="right" />][1] I even created a custom snippet of code the other day for displaying code in my[Wordpress][2] blog. The other day I was going through [Mashape's][3] documentation and their use of Gist for their [PHP][4] [API][5] examples finally hit home.

Gist is a simple way to share snippets of code with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository.

I've been creating quite a few [Github repositories][6] lately for [Mimeo][7] [Cloud Print][8], but Gists are just what I'm looking for when blogging. They work great for displaying code in technical blog posts without much work. When done with the blog series I will post the final code in a complete form as a full Github repository.
