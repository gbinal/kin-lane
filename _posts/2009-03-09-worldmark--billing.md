{% include JB/setup %}<p>Trying cover every pain point I have with Worldmark as I go through it to hopefully help someone from making the same mistake as me.I was closing up the credit card that I had my payments made through.So I needed to call them and have them invoice me.So I could either put in my billpay or just right checks as I receive.First it took me 3 separate times on hold to get to billing.</p>
