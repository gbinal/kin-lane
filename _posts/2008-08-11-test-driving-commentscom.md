    I was just test driving a new bookmarking and comment tracking tool called co.mments.com. I test drive these types of web services to see if there is a fit for use on social media marketing
    campaigns.<br />
    <br />
    It is a pretty simple straightforward approach...which I like. I prefer applications to do one thing and do it well.<br />
    <br />
    The tool has me bookmark my conversations as apposed to CoComment which is a firefox add-on and just tracks comments I place automatically.<br />
    <br />
    Maybe the tool needs mature a little and get a firefox add-on and some other bells and whistles. Then I could possibly find a use for it. Until then CoComment does the trick.
