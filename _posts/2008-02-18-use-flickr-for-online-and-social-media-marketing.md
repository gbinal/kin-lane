I have historically played around with many online marketing and social media marketing techniques. I play around from time to time to see what works and what doesn't.

Last year I was walking around with my daughter and taking pictures for our Eugene Local Search web site. I am trying to have pictures of [local attractions and business around Eugene, Oregon][1].

I took this picture of the [Eugene Federal Courthouse][2]. I then told a little story about it and happen to include a link [Eugene Web Design Services][3] which links to our web development company.

So it took a relevant geographical picture, some text, then linked with relevant keywords to our web site.

I have noticed I still get a some click through on this link as well as some search engine optimization value.

It is a nice example of using [Flickr][4] as part of your [online marketing][5] and [social media marketing][6] strategy.
