    I have historically played around with many online marketing and social media marketing techniques.I play around from time to time to see what works and what doesnt.Last year I was walking around
    with my daughter and taking pictures for our Eugene Local Search web site.I am trying to have pictures of local attractions and business around Eugene, Oregon.I took this picture of the Eugene
    Federal Courthouse.
