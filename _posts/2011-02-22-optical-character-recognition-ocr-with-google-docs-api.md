    Using the Google Docs List API you can convert high-resolution PDFs or images into editable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).Google Docs List API can extract the text from the
    following document formats: PDF Document (application/pdf) JPG Image (image/jpeg) PNG Image (image/png) GIF Image (image/gif) OCR is an experimental API feature and has a quota in place, limiting
    the number of calls that can be made.API quota is higher for Google Apps for Business users.OCR is available through the API by including the ocr=true parameter when uploading a file, then
    produces a separate Google Docs with extracted text for each uploaded PDF or Image.
