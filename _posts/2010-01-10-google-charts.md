I wanted to reintroduce everyone to [Google Charts][1]. If you haven't heard about it, it is a quick and easy way to create chart from data sources.

It is so easy to use. I think it is a tool that more people need to hear about and understand how they can easily use to embed charts in web pages, word documents, pdfs, spreadsheets and much more.

To create a chart, all you do is pass your data and labels for the data using a URL or web site address:<img class="alignnone" title="Sample Chart" src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=t:60,40&amp;chs=250x100&amp;chl=Hello|World" alt="" width="250" height="100" align="right" />
