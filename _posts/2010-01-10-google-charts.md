    I wanted to reintroduce everyone to Google Charts.If you havent heard about it, it is a quick and easy way to create chart from data sources.It is so easy to use.I think it is a tool that more
    people need to hear about and understand how they can easily use to embed charts in web pages, word documents, pdfs, spreadsheets and much more.To create a chart, all you do is pass your data and
    labels for the data using a URL or web site address: http://chart.
