    We added four new APIs, introducing a whole new type of APIs well be releasing from time to time here at Mimeo Connect.Im calling them Document Printing APIs, because they are focused around
    printing specific type of document.For new Mimeo developers, I will most likely reccommend you test drive one of our four Document Printing APIs: Poster Printing API Flyer &amp; Brochure API Card
    API Spiral Notebook API They are the easiest to get up and running with, enabling your sites and applications to print many of the common business documents we see.If our new Document APIs do not
    provide the document settings your looking for or if your an existing Mimeo customer, I may recommend using the Mimeo Connect REST API, which gives you more control over your Mimeo
    account.However developers can still use the new Document Printing APIs with your existing Mimeo account, if you wish.
