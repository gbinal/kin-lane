    I stumbled across a great post onMediaBistrocalled, The US Senate Adopts Scribd for Sharing Docs with Public.The Rules Committee of the US Senatereleased a report yesterdaywhere it recommended a
    number of services for Senators and their staffs to use: The Rules Committee has reached an agreement with Scribd.com for advertising-free Scribd sites for Members and Committees.Scribd is
    especially useful for viewing and sharing large documents that are not confidential, such as those intended for public access.As a free, web-based document sharing and display tool, scribed
    allows users to take a document in any format (Word, Adobe, Powertpoint)--upload it--and view it or share it on any computer or web-enabled mobile device without any additional programs or
    equipment.
