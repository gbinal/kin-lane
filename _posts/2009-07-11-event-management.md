{% include JB/setup %}<p>We just launched a new web site for our company WebEvents Global. It is a new start for our web presence. We do not really have a need for a web site to market our event management products and services.
We rely on worth of mouth and networking in the very close knit event and conference management industry.
It really bothers me that you can't Google event management or other top keywords and find us. We don't strive to be the largest or most recognized event management company, we enjoy being a "boutique" operations. I would like  web presence that represents this position in the industry.
So we have worked slowly to create a simple web site to present our selves. I have also worked on our social network presence somewhat by making sure our Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter profiles are in check.
It isn't much, but its a start. We are meeting this month to really flush out how the rest of the world sees us.
Even though we don't depend on it for getting work, it is nice to have a clearly defined online presence when I talk to vendors, partners, and other event industry folks we network with.
