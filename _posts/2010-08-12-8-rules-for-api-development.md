    I was reading a good post on getting your API right.They propose following these rules when developing your API: Use HTTP Use Your Verbs Keep Your URL/URIs Consistent Use Your Status Codes Expose
    (And Accept) Multiple Data Formats Protect Your Users with OAuth Dont Shut Off HTTP Authentication Entirely Document, Document, Document There is a lot more to it, but this is an excellent
    framework to follow when developing your Application Programming Interface (API).
