I was reading a good post on [getting your API right][1]. They propose following these rules when developing your [API][2]:[<img class="alignnone c1" title="oAuth" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/OAuth.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />][3]

  * Use HTTP
  * Use Your Verbs
  * Keep Your URL/URIs Consistent
  * Use Your Status Codes
  * Expose (And Accept) Multiple Data Formats
  * Protect Your Users with [OAuth][3]
  * Don't Shut Off HTTP Authentication Entirely
  * Document, Document, Document
There is a lot more to it, but this is an excellent framework to follow when developing your [Application Programming Interface (API)][4].
