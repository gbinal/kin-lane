    I do a lot of reading on topics ranging from APIs to Printing.I read articles, white-papers and other news from a wide variety of sources on my desktop, laptop, tablet and my mobile phone.When I
    come across longer articles I tend to save them for reading later, using a tool called Instapaper.With a single click, Instapaper allows me to save an article from any web page, and read it
    later.I can do this from any of my computers, tables or IPhone.
