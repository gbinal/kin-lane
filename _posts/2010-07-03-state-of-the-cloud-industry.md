<img class="alignnone c1" title="State of the Cloud" src="http://www.jackofallclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cloud_providers_snapshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I was just reading [State of the Cloud][1] over at [Jack of all Clouds][1]. They monitor the various players in the cloud game and who the movers and shakers are.

They state the known about the cloud industry. [Amazon][2] and Rackspace are the lead players.

What I like is that they introduced me to [Linode][3]. I haven't come across these guys yet. I'm reviewing their offerings now and more to come.

I am the biggest Amazon evangelist and use cloud platform heavily. As much as I love Google, Amazon and my IPhone, they all are reminders to me of the day in 1999 where I loved Microsoft the same way. I was a regular drinker the kool-aid.

Since then I've recovered, and when it comes to cloud computing I think diversity is good. I root for the little guy and hope they can deliver a set of tools that can compete with the big boys. Good luck [Linode][4].
