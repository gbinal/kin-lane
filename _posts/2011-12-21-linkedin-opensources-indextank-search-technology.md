<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/linkedin/LinkedIn-Developer-Network.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />[LinkedIn has just open-sourced the technology behind IndexTank][1] under the Apache 2.0 License.

The IndexTank technology has three separate toolsets:

  * **IndexEngine** \- A real-time fulltext search-and-indexing system designed to separate relevance signals from document text
  * **API** \- A RESTful interface that handles authentication, validation, and communication with the IndexEngine(s)
  * **Nebulizer** \- Multitenant framework to host and manage an unlimited number of indexes running over a layer of Infrastructure-as-a-Service
[<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/indextank/indextank_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][2] An example of IndexTank in action is, Reddit, which runs on IndexEngine and the API.

They have the [IndexTank Engine][3] and [IndexTank Service][4] code published at Github, and created a [LinkedIn Group to support it][5].
