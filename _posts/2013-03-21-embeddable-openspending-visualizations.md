    There are some really great examples of embeddable, open data goodness over at the OpenSpending project, which is operated by the Open Knowledge Foundation, a non-profit with a missions to
    promote open knowledge and data.The OpenSpending platform has a wealth of data regarding spending budgets from all over the world, providing key data that allows anyone track government and
    corporate financial transactions globally.The OpenSpending platform has plenty of data visualizations avialable for use, but until recently these tools were only fixed and available on the
    OpenSpending site.Now they have begun developing and publishing a handful of cool, embeddable widgets that can be published anywhere: Bubble Tree Tree Map Aggregate Table All three visualizations
    are available as open-source code on Github.OpenSpending also provides examples you can play with using jsfiddle: Bubble Tree Tree Map Aggregate Table The embeddable tools provided by
    OpenSpending are exactly the types of tools I want to organize as part of my Hacker Storytelling work.
