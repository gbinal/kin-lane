    With the growing number of 3D models used in 3D printing there is a building need for warehouse space to store these virtual products, and parts.Of course this is virtual warehouse space, but it
    has a lot of the same characteristics of warehousing for physical products.Google provides a 3D Warehouse for users of its SketchUp softare, and Shapeways provides a marketplace and warehouse in
    the form a gallery for its creators.Cloud Storage will definitely have a role to play in warehousing the growing number of 3D modeling files using platforms like Google Docs, Box.net, and
    Dropbox.
