    I have used several wiki environments to develop projects and provide oversight for several social media marketing campaigns. I am currently using Google Sites pretty heavily for writing several
    books and for building my strategy for work. I spend a great deal of time cultivating and gardening the wiki to keep up to date and keep my overview. I would like a simple publish or build
    feature allowing me to choose from Sitemap which sections and pages I would like to publish and have it create an output format from my selection. Then I could choose to publish as PDF, HTML or
    other popular format. Can you please get that built Google. Appreciate it.
