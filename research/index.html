<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Studying the API space is what I do. &nbsp;API Evangelist started almost 3 years ago as a research project in Summer of 2010. &nbsp;Here we are in 2013 and I'm still going. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To make money I've taken API Evangelist jobs and projects, to help me stay focused on the Business of APIs I'm accepting investement in a couple project areas:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Research.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitters API</a></strong> - Establish a deeper understanding of how Twitter has built their ecosystem.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Business of Twilos API</strong> - Twilio is an excellent blueprint for other API providers to follow. &nbsp;I'd like to create a formal blueprint based upon Twilios operation.</li>
<li><strong>Business of Amazon Web Service</strong>&nbsp;- Amazon is a flagship of everything cloud and APIs. &nbsp;I'd like to document the platform from incarnation to until present.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com/index.php">API Stack</a></strong> - Establish a curated directory of high value APIs, with a ranking and monitoring system to track progress around these APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Politics of APIs</strong> - All the challenges you face around APIs ranging from terms of use and developers rights to potential government regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the active research areas I'm working that are being funded. &nbsp;Upcoming research includes research and profiling in the business of:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Facebook's Open API &amp; Platform</li>
<li>Google APIs</li>
<li>LinkedIn Developer Platform</li>
<li>EBay</li>
</ul>
<p>Each research project produces all or many of the following components:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Raw Research</li>
<li>Blog Post(s)</li>
<li>White Paper(s)</li>
<li>Book(s)</li>
<li>Interactive Dashboard</li>
<li>Visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in any of these areas of API research, please <a title="contact me directly" href="../../contact/">contact me directly</a>. &nbsp;My goal is to provide content for my blogs and research that will educate everyone about the API space, while also funding what I do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't just enjoy understanding the API space. &nbsp;I believe APIs are going to assist in driving a healthy economy, government and become a ubiquiotous part of our everyday lives. &nbsp;</p>
