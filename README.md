Kin Lane
========

This is my personal blog. My name is Kin Lane, and I'm a technology professional focusing on the world of APIs.

While I publish often very technical pieces here on Kin Lane, it is mostly my personal thoughts, and reflect my more unpolished work.

If you are looking for my other work you should look at:

* [API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com)
* [API Voice](http://apivoice.com)
* [API Stack](http://theapistack.com)

You can also find other fictional works at [Alternate Kin Lane], and approaches to how I tell stories at [Hacker Storytelling](http://hackerstorytelling).

Kin Lane, and the rest of my public presence all operate as public, openly licensed Github repositories. To view the public side of Kin Lane, visit [kinlane.com](http://kinlane.com).
