<h1>Talks</h1>

<p>I have been publishing my talks in the last two years to Github. Since I started using reveal.js for the presentation framework, it has made it easier to publish my presentations online, using Github a default.</p>

<p>Over time I will find older talks and publish here as well. For now you will find my talks after 2012 published here.</p>
